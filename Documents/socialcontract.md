#Social Contract

- A good team member should be in time. If the member is late three times “fika” has to be offered at the next meeting. A member should notify the group if they know that they will be late. “Akademisk kvart” is in effect. 
- Sent = 5 min + självförvållat
- Fika = Kaffe/person


- Everyone is not at the same level of ambition, and that is ok. As long as everybody work the needed amount of hours in the end. 

- Varje medlem i gruppen gör sina reflektioner veckovis. 

- All members should follow the guidelines from scrum.

- If a member feels like he/she will not be able to complete their tasks in time, he/she must tell the team

- We will mainly work together 8-17 on weekdays and avoid weekends, regardless of how we work by ourselves.

- We will have a meeting every Thursday 09:00-12:00 (except for easter).

- We will check into adding one more meeting on mondays

- A member should strive to stay up to date in regards to group messages (Slack) and try to stay on-topic.

- All committed code should be commented and should be good enough that another member can edit it.

- The role as scrum master will rotate each week among Emil, Moa and Hanna.

- Before a code segment is committed as final it should have been reviewed by another member
