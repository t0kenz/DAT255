# Social Contract

A good team member should be in time. If the member is late three times “fika” has to be offered at the next meeting. A member should notify the group if they know that they will be late. “Akademisk kvart” is in effect.
Sent = 5 min + självförvållat
Fika = Kaffe/person

Everyone is not at the same level of ambition, and that is ok. As long as everybody work the needed amount of hours in the end. 

Each group member is obligated to do their own reflection on a weekly basis

All members should follow the guidelines from scrum.

If a member feels like he/she will not be able to complete their tasks in time, he/she must tell the team

We will mainly work together 8-17 on weekdays and avoid weekends, regardless of how we work by ourselves.

We will have a meeting every 
Monday 9.30-10 
Wednesday 12-17
Thursday 9-11

A member should strive to stay up to date in regards to group messages (Slack) and try to stay on-topic.

All committed code should be commented and should be good enough that another member can edit it.

The role as Scrum master will be permanent. The preliminary Scrum master is Emil.

Before a code segment is committed as final it should have been reviewed by another member

Pair programming should be used when appropriate.

The following will be responsible for compiling the KPI data before every weekly reflection meeting:
Robin - Burnup-chart
John -  Code Coverage
August - Code Deletion
