## Linus individual reflections

# Final reflection

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Throughout the course with every weekly reflection I feel like I've learnt a lot which I sought for when I decided to register on this course. Initially I wanted to get practical experience of how a "real" software engineering project might turn out to be in practice, and get more experience working in group. 

Furthermore, I've learnt to understand the importance of always reflecting on what you're learning. I feel like this is a major thing I will take with me through both in life and in other courses. Knowing what and how you're learning is key in getting a deeper understanding. I feel like I've grown in multiple areas of project work. I've tried out multiple different agile practices, for example pair programming which I've never thought worked in practice before but has changed my mind completely. I feel that I've gotten a more in-depth knowledge of what Scrum is, and why it is used at a such huge scale in the industry.

Iterating through my previous weekly reflections I can see that the most valuable lessons learnt for me have been the importance of communication, and communicating the right things. This is one of the things I'll bring with me in the future. 

To summarize and give a short report of what I've learnt and reflected on previously: 

- I've learnt to work more effectively in dynamic groups
- I've understood the importance of reflecting upon your learning and understanding 
- I've gotten a more in-depth knowledge of Javascript and the libraries used in the project (react native, redux, expo, androidSDK, etc.).


### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

From what I've gathered through weekly reflections, I can see a pattern where I'm week after week almost repeating myself. I always write that I try to encourage my fellow group members in learning something thoroughly, and I try to share my best understanding of a certain concept. In the future, I believe I should try to adapt to the person more, and try to give a more wholesome perspective, let's say for a task which I have previous experience in doing, share that knowledge and make sure that everyone understands it from the start. If I just give them the solution to committing something or solving a merge conflict in git, I don't really help them learn something. It's like the story about the fisherman, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime".

### What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

I have tried to my best ability always to participate in our meetings, especially when reviewing our sprints and working with our Scrum board. I had a small role in almost every task trying to contribute to my best abilities in any question brought up by the group. 

We didn't really develop any specific roles, but I've always tried to be available for any task. From the start there were a bit of a confusion when we were dealing with Scrum in the group, but I'm pretty sure this had to do with it being our first encounter to Scrum which caused this confusion. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


Throughout this course I have been constructing different goals in my weekly reflections that were primarily focused on reflecting the acquired knowledge onto our project. Initially these goals were quite ambitious, and I was trying to look ahead and think what we might need or want in the future. This led to me for one week learning about things not relevant to our project. During that week I focused on getting more in-depth knowledge using the androidSDK and finding suitable tools for our project. I would like to say now that it wasn't for nothing, but it produced no value for the group. The consecutive weeks I tried to refine my scope of my planned learning outcomes and succeeded better in producing value for my group. 

My goals for the week prior to this I believe I and everyone else in the group set goals that were similar to "finish the product". We were all quite stressed as we were sitting with the application the whole day before presentation. Last week I helped finishing the vessel info view with displaying relevant data, making sure we use the same way to send state between navigators, etc.

I think that the most important lesson learnt apart from my previously stated goals that it's important to always be self-aware of how much you're actually producing value when organizing and planinng and that sometimes it's easier to just "do it". This was something that both I and our group learnt in the later weeks after talking with one of the lecturers in the course.

# Week 8

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- As this is the second last reflection we make, I want to put extra focus on understanding the reflection parts and look into where we are, what still needs to be done. From the start I believe I had a goal (perhaps I didn't mention it) where I hoped I would get better at working in a group. That's why I chose to take both this course (software engineering project) and object oriented programming project. And the most important part is to finish the application.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- Right now we're working on just putting the bits together and creating a product out of them. I will try to read up the essential parts that might cause us to slow down or get stuck and share the found knowledge with the rest of the group. I will as always try to be the one who communicates with everyone and makes sure that we're on the right track.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

-   I have tried to be available as much as possible for every single meeting and participating and trying to add as much as possible to our group reflections and development. I have been making sure we keep our scrum board (trello) up to date and planning the remaining time prior to the presentation together with the group.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Instead of simply spending time on planning, we looked at our user stories, quickly created smaller tasks out of them and then we went straight into doing the tasks. This led to us actually being able to present something of value even though it taking us the whole day prior to the presentation.

#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- As the next week is the final sprint, I will look into the reflection parts even further and try to get a grasp of what we've been doing the last couple of weeks and summarize how it went and what I've learnt.


# Week 7

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- After talking with one of the lecturers of the course regarding planning and executing tasks, I've decided I want to look into the Scrum framework and see how we can progress without too much planning. Previously we've been putting way too much time into planning and it feels like it hasn't benefited us enough.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- This sprint we're switching up partners in order to solve some workload issues. We had some problems building the application which resulted in us having to switch up partners as the one I earlier was programming with could build the application until now. I will try to my best abilities share my experience and see if we both can learn something from this experience of rotaitng pair programming partners within the group.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

-  Like stated in previous reflections, I've been participating in most of the meetings (when we layed out our meeting schedule, the group knew I wouldn't be able to participate in every single one as the meetings would collide and there were no better alternatives). I have as per usual communicated for resolving our previous issues, which have been lack in communication. What that resulted in was to create more opportunities where we can sit and give a short report of where we are and if we've ran into any issues and so forth.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Instead of putting too much structure and planning into our project, we instead decided it was best that we put more time into actually doing tasks and getting somewhere. Essentially it felt like we were stuck in the "waterfall method" and we were too afraid of actually doing a task. 

#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- For next week I will try to learn/understand how we as a group can instead of spending too much time on planning instead adjust our focus and spend more time on actually doing tasks.

# Week 6

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to understand how we can structure workload in a more appropriate way. Due to recent holidays, it feels like we've lost our "workflow" somewhat. Therefore, I want to look into how we can improve our current situation and organize everything such that we can in the end produce a minimum valuable product.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I will try to integrate the rest of the team in my assigned tasks and hopefully help them learn some of my previous experiences in software development. We have had a horizontal slice-approach to how we divide workload in the team. We were suggested by the course examinator that we should try using a vertical slice-approach instead. I will try to look into how we can do this in the most appropriate way and share with the rest of the group.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- I spoke with the product owner regarding the product we're to produce and concluded that here's a pattern in how they work. I also studied the use cases and now more thoroughly understand what their work tasks are and can now also try to reason about what could help improve their day-to-day work.

- I've read up on some theory related to databases. I feel though that I didn't fully accomplish this learning objective, or at least now I would like to change it as I and the others in the team are not sure whether or not we need a databases. There are some data we want to store, but it feels excessive to some extent. We have a suitable model, but it feels like this wasn't what I aimed for as a learning objective.

#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- Understand the key issues with our current structure and solve them.

# Week 4/5


### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- We're currently in a seat with our product owner where we know roughly what they want and what we should produce as a MVP. Consequently, this has created a few tasks and I and another person in our group has been assigned to deal with the database part of the weekly sprint. I want to get an exhaustive picture of how we best should create an exhaustive database structure for our current use and future use.

- I want to understand how tugboat operators might use this product to minimize their current workload and find further features that they might want.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

- Once I get a more wholesome understanding of what tugboat operators in their current daily job, it'll help me explain to the others in the group and to the product owner how we can best develop the MVP. 

### What is my contribution towrads the team's application of Scrum?

- I have completed my assigned tasks from the weekly sprint log and participated in a majority of the weekly meetings. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Me and Jesper in the group was assigned a task where we would present our understanding of the existing code base to the rest of the group. This allowed me to get a better understanding of the pervasive idea behind the project. 

- I read up on example applicance of Scrum in other and bigger projects and got a better understanding of how we can use agile methods and Scrum in our project


#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- I will read up on more advanced database structure technology to find a suitable model for our software. I have read a course in databases earlier, and I will simply read up on some theory related to this and try to find other examples of more exhaustive database structures online.

- I will study the use cases and speak with the product owner. From the use cases I will try to recognize a pattern of certain tasks that can be improved by automating the process and/or task.  


# Week 3

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get a more in-depth knowledge in the current code base.
With this I mean that I want to on a graspable level be able to understand the idea behind their solutions to the problems creating an app like this.
- I also want to understand the applicance of Scrum in our project and agile methods in general in order to properly review and extend our applicance in the project in possible ways. 

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will continue as before, trying to first establish an understanding of a task or objective and then share my findings/understanding with the rest of the group in the most appropriate way. 

### What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?

- I have contributed in terms of participating in the meetings and constructing a proper way of applying scrum to our project. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Forcing myself to find situations where I want to get further understanding of a subject by asking the lecturer questions during breaks. 

- I have thoroughly studied litterature related to the tools we're to use in the project 

- Been in meetings discussing requirements for our project.


#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- I will aim to get a better understanding of the current existing code base by looking into how we can extend the current application base and from that figure out how we'll construct our MVP (minimum valuable product) for the product owner. I will also thoroughly try to process how things are executed and in turn create a flowchart or equivalent to give a more general overview of the project structure.

- I will try to participate in all meetings and discuss how we think scrum is best applied in our project. 


# Week 2

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- The importance of asking relevant questions during lectures. There was some confusion that led me into believing that we'd make something similar to what the past students who took this course made. 
- I want to get more in-depth knowledge of the tools involved in the upcoming project. These tools include deepened knowledge in Gradle, NodeJS, Javascript and other relevant technologies required for the project.
- Get a further understanding and establish the requirements for the project product. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will try to help everyone understand the content taken up during the lectures, supervisions and meetings if they feel unsure about something in particular by explaining my understanding of it which in turn would probably lead to a group discussion regarding the matter.
- I will try to make sure everyone's up to date if they've missed a meeting or similar to make sure everyone's on the right track.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I've participated in the meetings where we've discussed how we should use scrum and added my input of how we can deal with it in the most efficient and appropriate way for everyone in the group. Mainly the outcome has been that we'll be using Trello to structure our application of scrum and how we structure it on Trello (choice of colors, grouping categories after type etc.)

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:
- Throughly studied the lecture notes and further learnt more about scrum from online literature.
- The learning objective related to the roles of everyone in a scrum team was achieved during the point above.
- I've created a small android project getting more in-depth knowledge about the Android SDK and related tools like Android Studio. 

#### Learning objectives for the next week:
- I want to make sure that I understand and spend time on asking relevant questions during lectures/supervisions to get the most out of them and. (might sound fuzzy in some sense, but still important as it hasn't really been that actual for me before.) In order to do this, I will achieve this simply by trying to find situations when I find something confusing and instead of getting an unclear answer from a classmate or similar, ask the lecturer if something's unclear.
- I will try to get a more in-depth knowledge of the tools specified in the [first paragraph](#What-do-I-want-to-learn-or-understand-better?). I will achieve this by doing related tasks/exercises using Gradle, NodeJS, JS for example developing a small web-app with a backend and frontend.
- Understand the requirements of the product that we are to develop. I will achieve this by reading the case scenarios provided by the product owner and try to understand how we'll design our product thereafter.

# Week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to put more time into learning and getting a deeper understanding of the
scrum methodology. As it currently stands, I have a somewhat picture of how
it is used in practice, but lack some understanding of the theory behind it.

- I want to get a better understanding as a whole of the core issues that this
course brings up. Perhaps this sounds a bit too vague, but essentially I mean
that I want to understand why these methodologies are used, and why they
have proven to be beneficial.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I believe I have a lot to add when it comes to the programming parts of this
project. We all have different programming backgrounds, and I believe that
with my past experience and knowledge I can share my view and/or
understanding of a concept or similar. This applies to objectives beyond
programming as well.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- As of right now, it’s difficult to say as we have only so far declared three
members of the group as our “pool” of scrum masters, we haven’t really set
out any roles or any assignments. I suppose I’ll be a part of the development
team and that I’ll be contributing in terms of discussing what we can do
different and further improve our current use of scrum.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

- Get a more in-depth understanding and knowledge of Scrum. I will accomplish this by reading through the lecture notes and read literature related to the subject.

- Learn more about the roles in a Scrum team and their purpose

- Create a small Android project in order to get started with Android development.
