## Linus individual reflections

# Week 2

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- The importance of asking relevant questions during lectures. There was some confusion that led me into believing that we'd make something similar to what the past students who took this course made. 
- I want to get more in-depth knowledge of the tools involved in the upcoming project. These tools include deepened knowledge in Gradle, NodeJS, Javascript and other relevant technologies required for the project.
- Get a further understanding and establish the requirements for the project product. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will try to help everyone understand the content taken up during the lectures, supervisions and meetings if they feel unsure about something in particular by explaining my understanding of it which in turn would probably lead to a group discussion regarding the matter.
- I will try to make sure everyone's up to date if they've missed a meeting or similar to make sure everyone's on the right track.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I've participated in the meetings where we've discussed how we should use scrum and added my input of how we can deal with it in the most efficient and appropriate way for everyone in the group. Mainly the outcome has been that we'll be using Trello to structure our application of scrum and how we structure it on Trello (choice of colors, grouping categories after type etc.)

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:
- Throughly studied the lecture notes and further learnt more about scrum from online literature.
- The learning objective related to the roles of everyone in a scrum team was achieved during the point above.
- I've created a small android project getting more in-depth knowledge about the Android SDK and related tools like Android Studio. 

#### Learning objectives for the next week:
- I want to make sure that I understand and spend time on asking relevant questions during lectures/supervisions to get the most out of them and. (might sound fuzzy in some sense, but still important as it hasn't really been that actual for me before.) In order to do this, I will achieve this simply by trying to find situations when I find something confusing and instead of getting an unclear answer from a classmate or similar, ask the lecturer if something's unclear.
- I will try to get a more in-depth knowledge of the tools specified in the [first paragraph](#What-do-I-want-to-learn-or-understand-better?). I will achieve this by doing related tasks/exercises using Gradle, NodeJS, JS for example developing a small web-app with a backend and frontend.
- Understand the requirements of the product that we are to develop. I will achieve this by reading the case scenarios provided by the product owner and try to understand how we'll design our product thereafter.

# Week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to put more time into learning and getting a deeper understanding of the
scrum methodology. As it currently stands, I have a somewhat picture of how
it is used in practice, but lack some understanding of the theory behind it.

- I want to get a better understanding as a whole of the core issues that this
course brings up. Perhaps this sounds a bit too vague, but essentially I mean
that I want to understand why these methodologies are used, and why they
have proven to be beneficial.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I believe I have a lot to add when it comes to the programming parts of this
project. We all have different programming backgrounds, and I believe that
with my past experience and knowledge I can share my view and/or
understanding of a concept or similar. This applies to objectives beyond
programming as well.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- As of right now, it’s difficult to say as we have only so far declared three
members of the group as our “pool” of scrum masters, we haven’t really set
out any roles or any assignments. I suppose I’ll be a part of the development
team and that I’ll be contributing in terms of discussing what we can do
different and further improve our current use of scrum.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

- Get a more in-depth understanding and knowledge of Scrum. I will accomplish this by reading through the lecture notes and read literature related to the subject.

- Learn more about the roles in a Scrum team and their purpose

- Create a small Android project in order to get started with Android development.
