## Linus individual reflections

# Final reflection

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Throughout the course with every weekly reflection I feel like I've learnt a lot which I sought for when I decided to register on this course. Initially I wanted to get practical experience of how a "real" software engineering project might turn out to be in practice, and get more experience working in group. 

Furthermore, I've learnt to understand the importance of always reflecting on what you're learning. I feel like this is a major thing I will take with me through both in life and in other courses. Knowing what and how you're learning is key in getting a deeper understanding. I feel like I've grown in multiple areas of project work. I've tried out multiple different agile practices, for example pair programming which I've never thought worked in practice before but has changed my mind completely. I feel that I've gotten a more in-depth knowledge of what Scrum is, and why it is used at a such huge scale in the industry.

Iterating through my previous weekly reflections I can see that the most valuable lessons learnt for me have been the importance of communication, and communicating the right things. This is one of the things I'll bring with me in the future. 

To summarize and give a short report of what I've learnt and reflected on previously: 

- I've learnt to work more effectively in dynamic groups
- I've understood the importance of reflecting upon your learning and understanding 
- I've gotten a more in-depth knowledge of Javascript and the libraries used in the project (react native, redux, expo, androidSDK, etc.).


### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

From what I've gathered through weekly reflections, I can see a pattern where I'm week after week almost repeating myself. I always write that I try to encourage my fellow group members in learning something thoroughly, and I try to share my best understanding of a certain concept. In the future, I believe I should try to adapt to the person more, and try to give a more wholesome perspective, let's say for a task which I have previous experience in doing, share that knowledge and make sure that everyone understands it from the start. If I just give them the solution to committing something or solving a merge conflict in git, I don't really help them learn something. It's like the story about the fisherman, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime".

### What is my contribution towards the team's application of Scrum?

I have tried to my best ability always to participate in our meetings, especially when reviewing our sprints and working with our Scrum board. I had a small role in almost every task trying to contribute to my best abilities in any question brought up by the group. 

We didn't really develop any specific roles, but I've always tried to be available for any task. From the start there were a bit of a confusion when we were dealing with Scrum in the group, but I'm pretty sure this had to do with it being our first encounter to Scrum which caused this confusion. 

### What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


Throughout this course I have been constructing different goals in my weekly reflections that were primarily focused on reflecting the acquired knowledge onto our project. Initially these goals were quite ambitious, and I was trying to look ahead and think what we might need or want in the future. This led to me for one week learning about things not relevant to our project. During that week I focused on getting more in-depth knowledge using the androidSDK and finding suitable tools for our project. I would like to say now that it wasn't for nothing, but it produced no value for the group. The consecutive weeks I tried to refine my scope of my planned learning outcomes and succeeded better in producing value for my group. 

My goals for the week prior to this I believe I and everyone else in the group set goals that were similar to "finish the product". We were all quite stressed as we were sitting with the application the whole day before presentation. Last week I helped finishing the vessel info view with displaying relevant data, making sure we use the same way to send state between navigators, etc.

I think that the most important lesson learnt apart from my previously stated goals that it's important to always be self-aware of how much you're actually producing value when organizing and planinng and that sometimes it's easier to just "do it". This was something that both I and our group learnt in the later weeks after talking with one of the lecturers in the course.
