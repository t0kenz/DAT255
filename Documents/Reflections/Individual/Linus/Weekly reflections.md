## Linus individual reflections

# Week 6

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to understand how we can structure workload in a more appropriate way. Due to recent holidays, it feels like we've lost our "workflow" somewhat. Therefore, I want to look into how we can improve our current situation and organize everything such that we can in the end produce a minimum valuable product.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I will try to integrate the rest of the team in my assigned tasks and hopefully help them learn some of my previous experiences in software development. We have had a horizontal slice-approach to how we divide workload in the team. We were suggested by the course examinator that we should try using a vertical slice-approach instead. I will try to look into how we can do this in the most appropriate way and share with the rest of the group.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- I spoke with the product owner regarding the product we're to produce and concluded that here's a pattern in how they work. I also studied the use cases and now more thoroughly understand what their work tasks are and can now also try to reason about what could help improve their day-to-day work.

- I've read up on some theory related to databases. I feel though that I didn't fully accomplish this learning objective, or at least now I would like to change it as I and the others in the team are not sure whether or not we need a databases. There are some data we want to store, but it feels excessive to some extent. We have a suitable model, but it feels like this wasn't what I aimed for as a learning objective.

#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- Understand the key issues with our current structure and solve them.

# Week 4/5


### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- We're currently in a seat with our product owner where we know roughly what they want and what we should produce as a MVP. Consequently, this has created a few tasks and I and another person in our group has been assigned to deal with the database part of the weekly sprint. I want to get an exhaustive picture of how we best should create an exhaustive database structure for our current use and future use.

- I want to understand how tugboat operators might use this product to minimize their current workload and find further features that they might want.

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new? 

- Once I get a more wholesome understanding of what tugboat operators in their current daily job, it'll help me explain to the others in the group and to the product owner how we can best develop the MVP. 

### What is my contribution towrads the team's application of Scrum?

- I have completed my assigned tasks from the weekly sprint log and participated in a majority of the weekly meetings. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Me and Jesper in the group was assigned a task where we would present our understanding of the existing code base to the rest of the group. This allowed me to get a better understanding of the pervasive idea behind the project. 

- I read up on example applicance of Scrum in other and bigger projects and got a better understanding of how we can use agile methods and Scrum in our project


#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- I will read up on more advanced database structure technology to find a suitable model for our software. I have read a course in databases earlier, and I will simply read up on some theory related to this and try to find other examples of more exhaustive database structures online.

- I will study the use cases and speak with the product owner. From the use cases I will try to recognize a pattern of certain tasks that can be improved by automating the process and/or task.  


# Week 3

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get a more in-depth knowledge in the current code base.
With this I mean that I want to on a graspable level be able to understand the idea behind their solutions to the problems creating an app like this.
- I also want to understand the applicance of Scrum in our project and agile methods in general in order to properly review and extend our applicance in the project in possible ways. 

### How can I help someone learn, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will continue as before, trying to first establish an understanding of a task or objective and then share my findings/understanding with the rest of the group in the most appropriate way. 

### What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?

- I have contributed in terms of participating in the meetings and constructing a proper way of applying scrum to our project.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:

- Forcing myself to find situations where I want to get further understanding of a subject by asking the lecturer questions during breaks. 

- I have thoroughly studied litterature related to the tools we're to use in the project 

- Been in meetings discussing requirements for our project.


#### Learning objectives for the next week:

- I will aim to get a better understanding of the current existing code base by looking into how we can extend the current application base and from that figure out how we'll construct our MVP (minimum valuable product) for the product owner. I will also thoroughly try to process how things are executed and in turn create a flowchart or equivalent to give a more general overview of the project structure.

- I will try to participate in all meetings and discuss how we think scrum is best applied in our project. 


# Week 2

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- The importance of asking relevant questions during lectures. There was some confusion that led me into believing that we'd make something similar to what the past students who took this course made. 
- I want to get more in-depth knowledge of the tools involved in the upcoming project. These tools include deepened knowledge in Gradle, NodeJS, Javascript and other relevant technologies required for the project.
- Get a further understanding and establish the requirements for the project product. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will try to help everyone understand the content taken up during the lectures, supervisions and meetings if they feel unsure about something in particular by explaining my understanding of it which in turn would probably lead to a group discussion regarding the matter.
- I will try to make sure everyone's up to date if they've missed a meeting or similar to make sure everyone's on the right track.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I've participated in the meetings where we've discussed how we should use scrum and added my input of how we can deal with it in the most efficient and appropriate way for everyone in the group. Mainly the outcome has been that we'll be using Trello to structure our application of scrum and how we structure it on Trello (choice of colors, grouping categories after type etc.)

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### I reached my last week's learning objectives by:
- Throughly studied the lecture notes and further learnt more about scrum from online literature.
- The learning objective related to the roles of everyone in a scrum team was achieved during the point above.
- I've created a small android project getting more in-depth knowledge about the Android SDK and related tools like Android Studio. 

#### Learning objectives for the next week:
- I want to make sure that I understand and spend time on asking relevant questions during lectures/supervisions to get the most out of them and. (might sound fuzzy in some sense, but still important as it hasn't really been that actual for me before.) In order to do this, I will achieve this simply by trying to find situations when I find something confusing and instead of getting an unclear answer from a classmate or similar, ask the lecturer if something's unclear.
- I will try to get a more in-depth knowledge of the tools specified in the [first paragraph](#What-do-I-want-to-learn-or-understand-better?). I will achieve this by doing related tasks/exercises using Gradle, NodeJS, JS for example developing a small web-app with a backend and frontend.
- Understand the requirements of the product that we are to develop. I will achieve this by reading the case scenarios provided by the product owner and try to understand how we'll design our product thereafter.

# Week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to put more time into learning and getting a deeper understanding of the
scrum methodology. As it currently stands, I have a somewhat picture of how
it is used in practice, but lack some understanding of the theory behind it.

- I want to get a better understanding as a whole of the core issues that this
course brings up. Perhaps this sounds a bit too vague, but essentially I mean
that I want to understand why these methodologies are used, and why they
have proven to be beneficial.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- I believe I have a lot to add when it comes to the programming parts of this
project. We all have different programming backgrounds, and I believe that
with my past experience and knowledge I can share my view and/or
understanding of a concept or similar. This applies to objectives beyond
programming as well.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- As of right now, it’s difficult to say as we have only so far declared three
members of the group as our “pool” of scrum masters, we haven’t really set
out any roles or any assignments. I suppose I’ll be a part of the development
team and that I’ll be contributing in terms of discussing what we can do
different and further improve our current use of scrum.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

- Get a more in-depth understanding and knowledge of Scrum. I will accomplish this by reading through the lecture notes and read literature related to the subject.

- Learn more about the roles in a Scrum team and their purpose

- Create a small Android project in order to get started with Android development.
