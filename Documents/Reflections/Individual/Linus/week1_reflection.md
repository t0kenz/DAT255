# Week 1

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?


● I want to put more time into learning and getting a deeper understanding of the
scrum methodology. As it currently stands, I have a somewhat picture of how
it is used in practice, but lack some understanding of the theory behind it.

● I want to get a better understanding as a whole of the core issues that this
course brings up. Perhaps this sounds a bit too vague, but essentially I mean
that I want to understand why these methodologies are used, and why they
have proven to be beneficial.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

● I believe I have a lot to add when it comes to the programming parts of this
project. We all have different programming backgrounds, and I believe that
with my past experience and knowledge I can share my view and/or
understanding of a concept or similar. This applies to objectives beyond
programming as well.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?


● As of right now, it’s difficult to say as we have only so far declared three
members of the group as our “pool” of scrum masters, we haven’t really set
out any roles or any assignments. I suppose I’ll be a part of the development
team and that I’ll be contributing in terms of discussing what we can do
different and further improve our current use of scrum.

## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

● Get a more in-depth understanding and knowledge of Scrum. I will accomplish this by reading through the lecture notes and read literature related to the subject.

● Learn more about the roles in a Scrum team and their purpose

● Create a small Android project in order to get started with Android development.
