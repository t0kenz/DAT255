What do I want to learn or understand better?

    - I want to learn about working with a larger team than two to three
      persons as that is the group size that I am used to working in.

    - I want to become more comfortable using git and github.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    
    - As members of the team attends different programs, we have strengths
      and weaknesses in different areas. I hope to be able to help my team
      members with programing specific problems if they want help.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

    - I have attended all of our meetings and been somewhat active in the 
      discussion.     

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write
down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition
(technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was
achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how
to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe
the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is
perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can
motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous
week (e.g. describing the current situation)

    - I want to learn the concepts and process of working with scrum
      in more detail. This includes learning to understand the roles
      within scrum and the different stages of a sprint such as
      planning, review and retrospective.

    - I want to be more active in the group meetings next week and
      onwards.
