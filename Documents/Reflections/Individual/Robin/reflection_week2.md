# Reflection week 2 - Robin

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I need to learn the basics of javascript, nodeJS, android studio and gradle.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    
- Aside from helping someone that asks for help, I can share resources that I use if I find something that I consider helpful that is not on the course homepage.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- I have attended our meeting where we talked about how we are going to structure our user stories. I have also done some reading on scrum to understand it better.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

##### Last week
- Scrum: I have done some reading and feel that some of the concepts of scrum have stuck with me. But I still need to gain more knowledge to get to a state where I feel confident working with scrum. 
- git/github: Same has in the case of scrum, I have made progress but I do not feel fully confident working with git and github in a larger project yet. 
- While reading up on scrum and git/github is good for familiarizing one self, I think that the only way to really learn them are to actually do the scrum processes and use git/github. Therefore these two goals will be put on hold as the priority for next week is for me to familiarize myself with the project and the technologies used in the project.
##### Next week
- Get a basic understanding of javascript, nodeJS, android studio and gradle.
- Install the technologies needed for the project.
- Read and understand the code base.
