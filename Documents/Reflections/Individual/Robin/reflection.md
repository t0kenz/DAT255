# Week 4 and 5

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to learn what information a tugboat operator needs from an agent. I will do this by reading through our notes from the meetings with Sebastian at Svitzer and reading the scenario.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can help the team to understand the structure of the server.

### What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
- I have attended out meetings, taken part in the discussions and completed the user stories that I was assigned to do.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)
- I have been more active in our discussions, though more than a week has passed since the last reflection and we have started and completed our first sprint. I worked on the basis of the server Jesper and I learned a lot, however I did not contribute as much to the code as he did as he had more experience with javascript and nodejs. Some of my responsibilities in the next sprint will be to implement more functionality which really will test me in terms of how well I learned in the previous sprint as I will not be working with Jesper.

# Week 3

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I still feel that I want to be more active in our discussions, so this will be my goal. I will take notes during the week of things that I think be good to discuss during our meetings as it is easy to forget, I believe this will help me to be more active.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Aside from helping someone that asks for help, I can share resources that I use if I find something that I consider helpful that is not on the course homepage.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have attended our meeting with our product owner, our weekly retrospective meeting where I contributed with creating vertically sliced user stories and also our meeting with our contact person at Svitzer in which I took notes.

- I have gotten familiarized with android studio and gradle to the point where I think I need to be in. I have watched a few videos on javascript and also tried writing some code but I need to learn more. I have not had time to read or watch anything related to nodeJS.
I would say that this goal was quite too big. But learning javascript and nodeJS will probably be easier once we start coding for the project (next week).
- After some struggle on windows I decided to install ubuntu and the hassle with building the project reduced substantially.
- I have read some of the code, however I would say that this goal was too large as well. A more fitting goal would have been to understand the code on a scale of modules and files. Understanding some part of the code in detail will be necesarry when I will work with it.

# Week 2

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I need to learn the basics of javascript, nodeJS, android studio and gradle.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    
- Aside from helping someone that asks for help, I can share resources that I use if I find something that I consider helpful that is not on the course homepage.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- I have attended our meeting where we talked about how we are going to structure our user stories. I have also done some reading on scrum to understand it better.

##### Last week
- Scrum: I have done some reading and feel that some of the concepts of scrum have stuck with me. But I still need to gain more knowledge to get to a state where I feel confident working with scrum. 
- git/github: Same has in the case of scrum, I have made progress but I do not feel fully confident working with git and github in a larger project yet. 
- While reading up on scrum and git/github is good for familiarizing one self, I think that the only way to really learn them are to actually do the scrum processes and use git/github. Therefore these two goals will be put on hold as the priority for next week is for me to familiarize myself with the project and the technologies used in the project.
##### Next week
- Get a basic understanding of javascript, nodeJS, android studio and gradle.
- Install the technologies needed for the project.
- Read and understand the code base.

# Week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?

- I want to learn about working with a larger team than two to three persons as that is the group size that I am used to working in.

- I want to become more comfortable using git and github.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    
- As members of the team attends different programs, we have strengths and weaknesses in different areas. I hope to be able to help my team members with programing specific problems if they want help.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

- I have attended all of our meetings and been somewhat active in the discussion.

- I want to learn the concepts and process of working with scrum in more detail. This includes learning to understand the roles within scrum and the different stages of a sprint such as planning, review and retrospective.

- I want to be more active in the group meetings next week and onwards.
