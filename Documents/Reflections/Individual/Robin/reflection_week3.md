# Reflection week 3 - Robin

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I still feel that I wont to be more active in our discussions, so this will be my goal. I will take notes during the week of things that I think be good to discuss during our meetings as it is easy to forget, I believe this will help me to be more active.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Aside from helping someone that asks for help, I can share resources that I use if I find something that I consider helpful that is not on the course homepage.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have attended our meeting with our product owner, our weekly retrospective meeting where I contributed with creating vertically sliced user stories and also our meeting with our contact person at Svitzer in which I took notes.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)
- I have gotten familiarized with android studio and gradle to the point where I think I need to be in. I have watched a few videos on javascript and also tried writing some code but I need to learn more. I have not had time to read or watch anything related to nodeJS.
I would say that this goal was quite too big. But learning javascript and nodeJS will probably be easier once we start coding for the project (next week).
- After some struggle on windows I decided to install ubuntu and the hassle with building the project reduced substantially.
- I have read some of the code, however I would say that this goal was too large as well. A more fitting goal would have been to understand the code on a scale of modules and files. Understanding some part of the code in detail will be necesarry when I will work with it.
