### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

# Week 3
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to understand the features in the programs better in order to be more productive during the time I spend in this course 
- I want to understand what’s expected from us and our application
- I want to learn more about scrum 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- We are still in the beginning of the project and I’m, like many other group members, new to the programs that we will use. So, right now, I can share my thoughts and questions with the rest of the group and possibly resolve any uncertainties that other members in the group also might have
- I can make sure that I’m up to date with all the meetings, tasks, etc. and contribute as much as I can 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I’ve participated in three meetings with the group, been active in writing this week’s group reflection, discussed what came up on the meeting with the product owner and worked on the user stories

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- Still get a better understanding of how scrum works in practice 
--I feel like I get a better understanding of scrum every week, but it will probably get even more clear when we start with the sprints. 

- Learn more about the programming tools that we will use for coding by installing all the programs and do some tutorials
-- I’ve downloaded all the necessary programs and gotten Android Studio to work, with some help from my group members. 
-- I’ve tried to learn the JavaScript language by reading on the internet, watching tutorials and doing some simple coding. I believe that my JS skills will improve once we get started with coding the app.
-- I’ve also tried to figure out how the other programs work (how they communicate with each other, what they do, how we will use them and how to use them) such as expo, gradle, Android Studio, VSCode, etc. as much as possible during my time limit. It’s very much new information and programs that I’m not used to, so I feel like I must continue experimenting and reading on the internet in order to know exactly what I’m doing and how everything works. I’ve almost never even used the computer’s terminal before, so only figuring out how to use it takes some time. 
-- I’ve learned a lot, but I still have a long way to go if I want to understand everything.

- Know more about the project and application by reading all the existing instructions 
-- I’ve gained a broader insight into the project and our task as a tugboat operator by reading all the instructions, talking to the product owner and discussing them with the group. 


#### For the next week
- Still get a better understanding of how scrum works in practice. I want to have such a clear perception that I’m able to describe to other people that are new to scrum how it works, the difficulties, advantages, give tips etc. This will probably get more clear once we start with the sprints but I can also read even more on the internet. I will partly achieve this by taking an active part in this week’s sprint.
- Get a deeper knowledge and understanding of the development tools that we use, their features etc. so that I will be able to be more productive during the time I spend on this course. This includes improving my skills in JavaScript, getting an overview of the codebase, understanding how the tools cooperate etc. I will achieve this by continuing experimenting and reading on the internet, but also by starting with the first sprint. 
- Know more about the project, the requirements, features and the grasp of the application. I want to know every detail that is needed for us to develop the application as requested and for me to contribute more to the team’s deliveries. This will be achieved by participating in next week’s meeting with the product owner and discussing more with my team. It will get more clear once we start with the first sprint and start working more with the application.

# Week 4
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to understand the codebase better in order to know exactly where to make some changes 
- I want to understand the features of the programs better in order to be more productive during the time I spend in this course 
- I want to learn even more about scrum 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I've designed a prototype for the UI together with two other group members. It has really increased my understanding of the current app and its features and how we want to change it since it required that I was familiar with the old app. We presented our prototype for the other team members, product owner and the operator, and I can explain furhter to the team members if they have any questions or other ideas. 
- I can make sure that I’m up to date with all the meetings, tasks, etc. and contribute as much as I can. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- This week, I've designed a prototype for the UI of the app according to the product owner's and operator's wishes. It took some time to learn how the old app worked and it has not been easy to take everyones ideas and wishes in consideration in the UI, but I think we managed to design a user-friendly UI that the operator will like. I think my deliveries this week have been as expected and that the time I've spent is good. If I continue working like the prevoius week, my stess level will be good and the team will be happy. 
- I’ve also participated in all the meetings with the group, been active in writing this week’s group reflection and worked on the user stories

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- Still get a better understanding of how scrum works in practice 
-- I feel like I've learned a lot about how scrum works during the prevoius week, but I will keep this learning objective until next wewk. 

- Get a deeper knowledge and understanding of the development tools that we use
-- During the previous sprint, my task was to design a protorype for the UI. Therefore, I didn't work with our development tools that much. I will keep this learning objective. 

- Know more about the project
-- This week's sprint has really increased my understanding of this project and grasp of the application.
