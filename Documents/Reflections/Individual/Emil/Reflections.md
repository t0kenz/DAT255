# Reflections


## Week 9 - final reflections
In this last reflection, I'll answer all of the given questions except of the one which regards how I can help someone else since I don't think it's relevant at the end the of our work. However, I will reflect upon how I can help someone else in my future work, based on the knowledge and insights I've been given throughout this course. 

### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I've learned a lot of things during this course. First of all, I've improved my specific knowledge within JavaScript and React Native. Since we got a hole bunch of code from the existing application, searching through that code enhanced my understanding of the two code languages I previously mentioned. I also got a lot of help from other team mates in regards of understanding the code structure. I've realized the importance of domain specific knowledge (in this case: JavaScript and React Native) in order to understand and analyze a specific problem. In the future, I could get this knowledge by asking someone more knowlegdeable or simply by searching through the code structure myself. 

Second, I've learned to work with people who approaches a specific problem differently. We've been a diversed group, in terms of fields of study. This has lead to different approaches where some focus on the creation of value to the end customer and some focus on the technical implications of a specific soloution. Both approaches are equally important, in my view. But it's crucial to understand the differences in order to do a good job and create a manageable working climat. In future work projects, I'll try to apply this insight by simply try to figure out exactly what is aim/target of the individuals within the team. 

Third, I know have a practical experience of the difficulty to plan the future. During the first four weeks of our work, we didn't implement a single thing. All we did was planning our soloution. At the moment, it seemed like a good idea but it resulted in a heavy and stressful work situationen in the end. We did this even though we've been thaught, on the lectures, to just start doing something. In the end, you really have to experience something before it gets stuck in your head and turns into a lesson. So when I face similar work projects in the future, I'll try to create something in the begging that is valuable and from that develop further. I do also beilive that this approach could be applied on every kind of project-orientated work. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Regarding how I could help someone else in the future, I would like to connect to the point of how team members can have different approaches as mentioned above. I think that I've been pretty good at both understanding the value we should deliver to the customer and understanding the technical implications of a specific soloution, even though I've been better on the former than the latter. But, I think that I can use this ability to build a connection between the individuals within a team that prefer different approaches to problem. Because as I said, both approaches are of equal importance. Since I think of myself as beeing some form of leader in my future carreer, I think that this might be the biggest contirbution I could possibly give.  

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
During our work, I've held the role as scrum master. Even though this role hasn't been of significant importance (which we express  in our final group reflection) it has had some effect with regards to communicating with other teams. To make better use of this function in the future, I think that it's important to also discuss specific tehcnical implementations with other groups. We realized in the end of the course that several teams had crerated something that we also wanted to create but didn't because the lack of time. But if we had discussed technical implications with other groups we would have been to copy their soloution and thereby create more value for our product owner.

Moreover, I contributed in the formulation of our user stories and tried to make them 

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

## Week 8
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Since the upcoming week will be the last, I neew to figure out how me should present our soloution in a proper manner which requires me to get a good understanding of how the parts we been working on during the last week will work together. 
- I want to know more about how other groups has created value through their soloutions and moreover how they reflected upon their work. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will participate in every meeting during this week and try to contribute by reflecting upon our work and making sure that everything works before our presentation
- With my knowledge about the timestamps and state types, I think I can contribute with this knowledge during our last work and the presentation since I have good understanding of how the timestamp-system works. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- During the past week, I've been unavailable during our reflection session but I tried to compensate by starting work on the structure of our final reflection together with some team mates.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- During the last week, I finalized the start view together with my programming group and got a better understanding of how to use React native.
- During the last week, I tried to push the group towards focusing on the minimal valuable product which I think we did. 
- During the upcoming week, I'm more avaiable which ables me to contribute to our final reflection and our presentation. Since I've done some presentations in previous work and courses, I think that I can be helpful in this work. 
- I need to learn more about how every part of the soloution will fit together which I will do by simply asking my team to clarify the questions I have. 
- I also want to abstract my perspective a little bit during this last week and try to focus on what I've learned during the hole course. I will do this by putting some extra effert into both our last group reflection as well as my individual one. 

## Week 7
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to learn more about the algoritm that should search for the information we need for a specific portcall
- I want to learn more about how to create views in react-native and more specific a nestled view

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can help others to narrow down the scope of their work since we're now running out of time
- I can contribute to my programming group by read more about react-native before we meet next time since

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I made the suggestion this week to narrow down our scope in order to deliver something valueable to the product owner. 
- I made the suggestion to the group that we should just start working with something instead of focusing on writing good user stories and tasks. I feel that this have had some effect. 

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- During the past week I've learned more about the APIs used in portCDM. I wrote down all the neccessary APIs and how to communicate with them at our repo in order to share it with my team. 
- During the past week I've also written down all time stamps in portCDM that are related to towage in order for us to get an understanding of the time-stamp system. 
- During the upcoming week I need to develop a start view together with my programming group. In order to make that possible, I need to learn more about how react-native works and specifically the nestled views.
- During the upcoming week, I want to contribute to preparing the team for the last sprint and make sure that we'll get the application up and running. That means that we need to really focus on the essential parts of our soloution. I will do this by keep pushing for that we need to narrow down the scope of our work and focus on the parts that makes the application ready to go. 


## Week 6
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

- During the past week, I've got a better understanding of how the APIs work through searching the specifications from PortCDM
- During the upcoming week, I will establish a document with all the state types/time stamps we need to subscribe to and which API we should use to do that. This will be needed in order for other team mates to do their work. 

## Week 5
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get a better understanding of the APIs and data strucuture currently used in the PortCDM-database in order to know how we should use it in our own database. 


### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

- In the role as Scrum master, I constantly communicate with other groups and it's therefore possible for me to help them as well as my other team mates

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I was partly responsible for creating a set of user stories during the past week which we reviewed to our product owner. We've now changed these stories but they were a good foundation on which we could develop them further. 
- As a scrum master, I'm currently responsible for the communication with other teams, securing that we use our scrum board in a proper way and that our reflections lead the way for the changes we need to do in our work.

## Week 4
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- At the moment, we have a conceptual idea over what we should deliver to our PO and the end user. I want to understand how we should develop our UI even further and I will try to do this by painting a UI. 
- At the moment, I have some understanding of the different time stamps and state tapes that are used in the current application. I want to understand these even better and get a sense of which stamps/types the tugboat operator use. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- When I get a better understanding of the state types/time stamps used in the application, I'm able to share this knowledge with my team mates.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- During the past week I reached almost all my ambitions except of the part where I was supposed to read the scenario even more. I haven't got the time to do that unfortunately. 
- During the upcoming week I want to: 
	- Get a better understanding of the scenario we should be able to tackle and analyze if our conceptual solution will do this. 
	- Develop a conceptual idea over how our UI should manifest itself
- I will reach this by
	- Reading the scenarion once again
	- Develop a painting that shows our different UIs


## Week 3
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to understand the current code base and application even further, why I during the upcoming week will try to change some output of the application in order to see how it's responding. 
- I want to learn more about the User stories since I'm the Scrum Master. The problems I have at the moment are to figure out the scope of the stories and how to write good acceptance criteria. I will ask for some help during our next review session in order to tackle these problems. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will sit down with some other team members from my class and try to figure out the code structure. During that session, I think that I can contribute to others understanding as well as they can contribute to mine.
- As a Scrum master, I've been responsible for handing out tasks during the upcoming week. I think this will make it easier for everyone else to understand what they are supposed to do. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As mentioned before, I have the role as Scrum Master. In this role, I've taken some initiatives during the last week: 
	- I've created a new Slack Channel in the Course Slack. In this, we'll discussion 	which information from the tug boat (our part) other groups depend on and what 		information we need from other groups. 
	- I led the work with creating the first set of tasks from our first real User 		Story. We've added velocities to each task which will make it easier for us to 		follow up on our KPI:s. 
	- I've been in contact with the tugboat operator and established a meeting session 	during which discussed what needs this operator has and how we can fulfill 		those needs.

That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- I've reach my learning objectives through: 
	- Reading about JavaScript, NodeJs, Git, Expo and installing all the programs 		needed for our work
	- Arrange a meeting with the tugboat operator during which I got some answers to 	what value our application should and should not deliver 
- During the upcoming week I want to 
	1. get deeper knowledge about the current code structure of the application
	2. create some User Stories that adds value to our customer
	3. get a even better understanding of how we depend on other groups in the value 	chain
- I will reach this targets by
	1. together with other team members, analyze the code structure and try to create 	some visible change in the application
	2. create some User Stories together with our group and review these stories 		during the upcoming review session
	3. read the scenario once more and really focus on how other groups depend on us 	and how we depend on them, regarding information exchange

## Week 2
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to learn more about the programming language and tools we’ll be using to build the application, especially JavaScript, NodeJS and Gradle
- I want to get deeper knowledge about the requirements for the application that we’ll build. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can be up to date regarding what’s happening in the group and with each group member and constantly seek to help other members. 
- I can talk to my classmates, whom missed today’s meeting, and get them updated on what we talked about.

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I will probably be the Scrum master which will be an important role against executing scrum in a good and efficient way
- During today’s meeting I asked a lot of questions regarding how we should use Scrum which led to some clarifying decisions in which we decided who we should build our user stories, how we should map our tasks and in general use Scrum.   

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- I’ve reached my learning objectives that I stated during last week’s reflection: 
	- I’ve learn more about Scrum by reading literature and repeating the lectures on 	that topic. 
	- I’ve watched some videos regarding Git and how to use version control. 
	- I’ve listened to our customers in order to get a better understanding of what we 	should do
- During the following week I want to: 
	- deepen my knowledge within the programming language and tools we’ll be using to 	build the application, especially JavaScript, NodeJS and Gradle
	- understand what kind of application we should build better
- I will reach these targets by: 
	- read more about NodeJS, Javascript and Gradle in litterature
	-download, install and navigate in the software programs we’ll be using
	- read the case scenario and try to understand how it affects our work


## Week 1
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- At the moment, I want to understand the scrum methodology even better and further on, next week, I want to see how scrum can be used in practise. 
- I want to understand more about the project itself, which we will do during next week. 
- I need to understand the tools we’ll be using to follow up our KPI’s and the different code language we’ll be using in order to complete the project and the product. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- We have not distributed any work assignments yet so it’s hard for me to help another individual but I do think that my skills and knowledges will be useful during the next week when it comes to establishing the project and getting the team together. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I will be one of the scrum masters because the role will be rotated among me and 	two other team members. 
- I have taken initiatives in the reflection of this week to focus our discussion on 	the three main questions of reflection. The reason for this was to find a solid 	and common ground for our future reflections. Hopefully, this will increase our 	ability to create weekly tasks that are based on our reflections.
