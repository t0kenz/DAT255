# Reflections

## Questions
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

## Week 5
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get a better understanding of the APIs and data strucuture currently used in the PortCDM-database in order to know how we should use it in our own database. 


### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since I'm responsible for learning more about the APIs used today, I can share this knowledge with my team members
- In the role as Scrum master, I constantly communicate with other groups and it's therefore possible for me to help them as well as my other team mates

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I was partly responsible for creating a set of user stories during the past week which we reviewed to our product owner. We've now changed these stories but they were a good foundation on which we could develop them further. 
- As a scrum master, I'm currently responsible for the communication with other teams, securing that we use our scrum board in a proper way and that our reflections lead the way for the changes we need to do in our work. 

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- During the past week I've reached my learning objects through;
	- Creating a painting of how our UI should look
	- Reading the Scenario
- During the upcoming week, I want to learn more about how the APIs and data strucuture currently used in the PortCDM-database in order to know how we should use it in our own database. 
- I will reach this by reading the PortCDM-APIs with another team member who has a good understanding of JavaScript

## Week 4
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- At the moment, we have a conceptual idea over what we should deliver to our PO and the end user. I want to understand how we should develop our UI even further and I will try to do this by painting a UI. 
- At the moment, I have some understanding of the different time stamps and state tapes that are used in the current application. I want to understand these even better and get a sense of which stamps/types the tugboat operator use. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- When I get a better understanding of the state types/time stamps used in the application, I'm able to share this knowledge with my team mates. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I was partly responsible for creating a set of user stories during the past week which we reviewed to our product owner. We've now changed these stories but they were a good foundation on which we could develop them further. 
- As a scrum master, I'm currently responsible for the communication with other teams, securing that we use our scrum board in a proper way and that our reflections lead the way for the changes we need to do in our work. At the moment, I see the need for more and deeper contact with other groups why I will contact them during the upcoming week to present our soloution.  

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- During the past week I reached almost all my ambitions except of the part where I was supposed to read the scenario even more. I haven't got the time to do that unfortunately. 
- During the upcoming week I want to: 
	- Get a better understanding of the scenario we should be able to tackle and analyze if our conceptual solution will do this. 
	- Develop a conceptual idea over how our UI should manifest itself
- I will reach this by
	- Reading the scenarion once again
	- Develop a painting that shows our different UIs


## Week 3
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to understand the current code base and application even further, why I during the upcoming week will try to change some output of the application in order to see how it's responding. 
- I want to learn more about the User stories since I'm the Scrum Master. The problems I have at the moment are to figure out the scope of the stories and how to write good acceptance criteria. I will ask for some help during our next review session in order to tackle these problems. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will sit down with some other team members from my class and try to figure out the code structure. During that session, I think that I can contribute to others understanding as well as they can contribute to mine.
- As a Scrum master, I've been responsible for handing out tasks during the upcoming week. I think this will make it easier for everyone else to understand what they are supposed to do. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As mentioned before, I have the role as Scrum Master. In this role, I've taken some initiatives during the last week: 
	- I've created a new Slack Channel in the Course Slack. In this, we'll discussion 	which information from the tug boat (our part) other groups depend on and what 		information we need from other groups. 
	- I led the work with creating the first set of tasks from our first real User 		Story. We've added velocities to each task which will make it easier for us to 		follow up on our KPI:s. 
	- I've been in contact with the tugboat operator and established a meeting session 	during which discussed what needs this operator has and how we can fulfill 		those needs. 

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- I've reach my learning objectives through: 
	- Reading about JavaScript, NodeJs, Git, Expo and installing all the programs 		needed for our work
	- Arrange a meeting with the tugboat operator during which I got some answers to 	what value our application should and should not deliver 
- During the upcoming week I want to 
	1. get deeper knowledge about the current code structure of the application
	2. create some User Stories that adds value to our customer
	3. get a even better understanding of how we depend on other groups in the value 	chain
- I will reach this targets by
	1. together with other team members, analyze the code structure and try to create 	some visible change in the application
	2. create some User Stories together with our group and review these stories 		during the upcoming review session
	3. read the scenario once more and really focus on how other groups depend on us 	and how we depend on them, regarding information exchange

## Week 2
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to learn more about the programming language and tools we’ll be using to build the application, especially JavaScript, NodeJS and Gradle
- I want to get deeper knowledge about the requirements for the application that we’ll build. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can be up to date regarding what’s happening in the group and with each group member and constantly seek to help other members. 
- I can talk to my classmates, whom missed today’s meeting, and get them updated on what we talked about.

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I will probably be the Scrum master which will be an important role against executing scrum in a good and efficient way
- During today’s meeting I asked a lot of questions regarding how we should use Scrum which led to some clarifying decisions in which we decided who we should build our user stories, how we should map our tasks and in general use Scrum.   

### 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

- I’ve reached my learning objectives that I stated during last week’s reflection: 
	- I’ve learn more about Scrum by reading literature and repeating the lectures on 	that topic. 
	- I’ve watched some videos regarding Git and how to use version control. 
	- I’ve listened to our customers in order to get a better understanding of what we 	should do
- During the following week I want to: 
	- deepen my knowledge within the programming language and tools we’ll be using to 	build the application, especially JavaScript, NodeJS and Gradle
	- understand what kind of application we should build better
- I will reach these targets by: 
	- read more about NodeJS, Javascript and Gradle in litterature
	-download, install and navigate in the software programs we’ll be using
	- read the case scenario and try to understand how it affects our work


## Week 1
### 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
- At the moment, I want to understand the scrum methodology even better and further on, next week, I want to see how scrum can be used in practise. 
- I want to understand more about the project itself, which we will do during next week. 
- I need to understand the tools we’ll be using to follow up our KPI’s and the different code language we’ll be using in order to complete the project and the product. 

### 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- We have not distributed any work assignments yet so it’s hard for me to help another individual but I do think that my skills and knowledges will be useful during the next week when it comes to establishing the project and getting the team together. 

### 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I will be one of the scrum masters because the role will be rotated among me and 	two other team members. 
- I have taken initiatives in the reflection of this week to focus our discussion on 	the three main questions of reflection. The reason for this was to find a solid 	and common ground for our future reflections. Hopefully, this will increase our 	ability to create weekly tasks that are based on our reflections.
