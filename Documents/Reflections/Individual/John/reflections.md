## Reflections each week by John - week 9 Final reflection

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
 - My goals from the beginning in the course was that i wanted to get better at programming better together with a group. I have realized during the course that one important aspect that is necessary to do this well is good planning. But I've also realized that sometimes its important not to plan too much and to just try and get things done instead. I believe that in the future is should further try to do more work and less planning. The reason for this is that i have sometimes felt that i haven't done as much as i could.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- During this project there have been a lot of different issues. But i feel that i have on occasion been able to help others with problems by simply being there and analyzing the problem and giving my input on it. I can't always necessarily help and solve the problem but i do believe that it is important that i keep on trying. Furthermore i believe that programming in groups or learning new things in groups is easier than trying to learn something alone so i will take that into account in the future.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have tried to participate in the planning process and make sure that we all have tasks to do including myself. However now i feel as if we have made too many tasks and that we won't be able to complete all of them. Since we now know what we want to do the best i can do to accomplish our goals is to make sure to try and help with some tasks and to communicate when im available. I've also made sure to try and take on some tasks for myself so that im contributing value to the team and not being passive.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For the next week
This week i helped by giving some input on the send portcall feature. Unfortunately i wasn't able to work on it as much as everyone else but i still feel that the time i spent on it provided some value in completing the application. I also spent a lot of time on the final reflection and some time on one of the KPI's. During this course i have learnt a lot of things. I have learned about Javascript and using react to make apps. I have also learnt a lot about applying scrum and making sure to not spend all too much time on meetings and planning and that it is important to get things done instead. In the future i want to get even better at using agile methods. I can do this by taking my knowledge and using it in other projects. I can as an example make sure to not make such big tasks for myself and continue to reflect on how I'm doing.


## Reflections each week by John - week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I've used trello before in other software projects but not truly incorporated with scrum which caused a few problems so therefore i would like to get better at agile practices and scrum so that i will be better at it in the future
I would also like to just get better at programming with a big group in general since i know that it is not an easy task and i believe that it will be useful
Another thing that i would like to get better at is just at structuring and planning projects in general

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I know that everyone in the team is good at different things and have different knowledges. Therefore i can try to help them by sharing my knowledge in case they are struggling with something

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
As of yet no code has been written but i have participated in all our meetings so far and i feel that i have contributed to them. More on this topic in later weeks

### For the next week
As of yet no goals have been set which means that i have accomplished my goals so far
Next week i want get a better understanding of what the project is about.
Other than that i would also just like to understand scrum better which i will (hopefully) learn by attending the lectures next week

Basically the same as last week not much has changed

As of yet no goals have been set which means that i have accomplished my goals so far
Next week i want get a better understanding of the project that we will be working with so that i can better know how we should plan the project
I want to focus on understanding the app and js and stuff like that

## Reflections each week by John - week 3
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I've thought about what i really want to learn about. My conclusion is that i want to learn more about the process of appplicating agile methods/scrum in a project. Also i want to get better at taking responsibility in a project. The reason for this is that i feel that i haven't taken enough responsibility before. I can do this by being more active in discussions and overall just communicating better with my team.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help them by providing the knowledge i have. If i encounter a problem in the process and solve it i can share my solution with the team. Also if someone is asking for help and i have the knowledge for it i can help them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in most meetings and i have also tried to be a part of the whole process. That is i have been trying to keep up communication with the team so that i know what is going on. I have also been trying to help by trying to make the team focus on the current important task in some situations. I will try to do this better by participating even more in discussions.

### For the next week
So far i have contributed to the team by being there when i talked to the product ownerr and by making sure that i can build the app on my computer. I have also tried to be active on meetings so that we can focus on the tasks that are most important.
I have partly accomplished the goal of understanding the app better since i can now build the project on my computer. Next week i want to try and focus on understanding how the app works and in which way the code works so that we can better know which part we need to focus on changing/adding functionality to.

### For the next week
Next week I will make sure to finish the tasks I have to do to for the sprint and since i missed some meetings last week i will try to make absolutely sure that i don't miss any this week while also making sure to read up on what i missed last week.

## Reflections each week by John - week 6
What do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now i mostly want to focus on making my planning skills better since it seems that there is not much time left and we still have a lot to do. Therefore i want to get better at planning so that i can do it better in the future.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the issues right now seem to be to get all of the parts we have made to work together I can help by trying to communicate with the team and help by explaining how the parts that i have worked on can fit together with the rest.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have tried to participate in the planning process and make sure that we all have tasks to do including myself. However now i feel as if we have made too many tasks and that we won't be able to complete all of them. Therefore i want to contribute in the future by maybe reconsidering what we can do.

### For the next week
Next week i will make sure to talk to the others in the team so that we can think about what we can do with the app in the time that is left.

## Reflections each week by John - week 7
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Right now i mostly want to focus on making my planning skills better since it seems that there is not much time left and we still have a lot to do. Therefore i want to get better at planning so that i can do it better in the future. This is still what i want to learn the most but i have also realized that sometimes its important to just try and solve a problem without planning on how it should be done therefore i want to get a balance between these two aspects of planning and trying to get things done.

### For the next week
Next week i will go to our meetings and see if someone who can build the project is free when i am so that we can work together.

Since the issues right now seem to be to get all of the parts we have made to work together I can help by trying to communicate with the team and help by explaining how the parts that i have worked on can fit together with the rest. But in general when trying to help the team to learn something new I can help by asking questions to my team members so that not only they can learn but I as well can.
