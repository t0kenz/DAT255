
## Reflections each week by John - week 1

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I've used trello before in other software projects but not truly incorporated with scrum which caused a few problems so therefore i would like to get better at agile practices and scrum so that i will be better at it in the future
- I would also like to just get better at programming with a big group in general since  i know that it is not an easy task and i believe that it will be useful
- Another thing that i would like to get better at is just at structuring and planning projects in general

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I know that everyone in the team is good at different things and have different knowledges. Therefore i can try to help them by sharing my knowledge in case they are struggling with something

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As of yet no code has been written but  i have participated in all our meetings so far and i feel that i have contributed to them. More on this topic in later weeks

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For the next week



- As of yet no goals have been set which means that i have accomplished my goals so far
- Next week i want get a better understanding o## Reflections each week by John - week 4

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
 - I've thought about what i really want to learn about. My conclusion is that i want to learn more about the process of appplicating agile methods/scrum in a project. Also i want to get better at taking responsibility in a project. The reason for this is that i feel that i haven't taken enough responsibility before. I can do this by being more active in discussions and overall just communicating better with my team.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can help them by providing the knowledge i have. If i encounter a problem in the process and solve it i can share my solution with the team. Also if someone is asking for help and i have the knowledge for it i can help them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have participated in most meetings and i have also tried to be a part of the whole process. That is i have been trying to keep up communication with the team so that i know what is going on. I have also been trying to help by trying to make the team focus on the current important task in some situations. I will try to do this better by participating even more in discussions.

#### For the next week
Next week I will make sure to finish the tasks I have to do to for the sprint and since i missed some meetings last week i will try to make absolutely sure that i don't miss any this week while also making sure to read up on what i missed last week.f the project that we will be working with so that i can better know how we should plan the project
- Other than that i would also just like to understand scrum better which i will (hopefully) learn by attending the lectures next week



## Reflections each week by John - week 2
Basically the same as last week not much has changed

#### For the next week
- So far i have contributed to the team by being there when i talked to the product ownerr and by making sure that i can build the app on my computer. I have also tried to be active on meetings so that we can focus on the tasks that are most important.
- I have partly accomplished the goal of understanding the app better since i can now build the project on my computer. Next week i want to try and focus on understanding how the app works and in which way the code works so that we can better know which part we need to focus on changing/adding functionality to.

## Reflections each week by John - week 6

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
 - Right now i mostly want to focus on making my planning skills better since it seems that there is not much time left and we still have a lot to do. Therefore i want to get better at planning so that i can do it better in the future.


### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since the issues right now seem to be to get all of the parts we have made to work together I can help by trying to communicate with the team and help by explaining how the parts that i have worked on can fit together with the rest.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have tried to participate in the planning process and make sure that we all have tasks to do including myself. However now i feel as if we have made too many tasks and that we won't be able to complete all of them. Therefore i want to contribute in the future by maybe reconsidering what we can do.

#### For the next week
Next week i will make sure to talk to the others in the team so that we can think about what we can do with the app in the time that is left.
