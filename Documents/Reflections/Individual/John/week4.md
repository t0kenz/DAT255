
## Reflections each week by John

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
 - I've thought about what i really want to learn about. My conclusion is that i want to learn more about the process of appplicating agile methods/scrum in a project. Also i want to get better at taking responsibility in a project. The reason for this is that i feel that i haven't taken enough responsibility before. I can do this by being more active in discussions and overall just communicating better with my team.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can help them by providing the knowledge i have. If i encounter a problem in the process and solve it i can share my solution with the team. Also if someone is asking for help and i have the knowledge for it i can help them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have participated in most meetings and i have also tried to be a part of the whole process. That is i have been trying to keep up communication with the team so that i know what is going on. I have also been trying to help by trying to make the team focus on the current important task in some situations. I will try to do this better by participating even more in discussions.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For the next week
Next week I will make sure to finish the tasks I have to do to for the sprint and since i missed some meetings last week i will try to make absolutely sure that i don't miss any this week while also making sure to read up on what i missed last week.
