## Reflections each week by Jesper

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I've used trello before in other software projects but not truly incorporated with scrum which caused a few problems so therefore i would like to get better at agile practices and scrum so that i will be better at it in the future
- I would also like to just get better at programming with a big group in general since  i know that it is not an easy task and i believe that it will be useful
- Another thing that i would like to get better at is just at structuring and planning projects in general

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I know that everyone in the team is good at different things and have different knowledges. Therefore i can try to help them by sharing my knowledge in case they are struggling with something

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As of yet no code has been written but  i have participated in all our meetings so far and i feel that i have contributed to them. More on this topic in later weeks

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For the next week



- As of yet no goals have been set which means that i have accomplished my goals so far
- Next week i want get a better understanding of the project that we will be working with so that i can better know how we should plan the project
- Other than that i would also just like to understand scrum better which i will (hopefully) learn by attending the lectures next week
