### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means 
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

# Week 1


### What do I want to learn or understand better?
-       I need a better overview over the workflow, scrum and the project itself.
-       There are also a few communication channels that are new to me, and I want to understand them better and see the structure of them, together.
-       I want to understand both how scrum works in theory and how it could be used in this project
-       In order to get a better overview, I need to get more information about the “coding parts” of the project, to learn more within that area.




### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-       My hopes is that I can develop my management skills as one of three scrum masters, and also to contribute with these skills to help organize workflow and work tasks within the group.




### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
-   	So far I don’t have enough information and knowledge of Scrum to comment this much further, however, I will make sure I am up to date with deadlines, sprints and work tasks to help develop the project.




### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means 
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down 
what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, 
concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you 
would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by 
motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s 
each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the 
outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### For the next week
During the following week I aim to:
-  	Understand Scrum, both theoretical and also how Scrum could be useful in this particular problem
- 	Be well aware of what is expected from a Scrum master
- 	Understand the project, the code foundation that is needed and the customer’s wishes as well as what I need to get more knowledge within to contribute to the project and the development of code.
- 	Feel comfortable with the project structure, in order to see what natural steps should be taken further on.


# Week 2


### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to get a basic insight of NodeJS and JavaScript, which are both new to me. This will be acomplished by reading beginner guides and overviews of how they are used and also how they could contribute to efficiency in our project.
- There is still a lot I can learn and understand when it comes to scrum, and mainly the practical use of it. Until now I have read a lot of theory about it but still have a lot of learn when it comes to actually implement it in a project.
- Something I need to constantly think about during the project is to always double check or ask for help when it comes to areas I previously haven't worked with, to make sure both me and the group get the best possible outcome of the project and the course.


### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since I don't have any experience with javascript oc NodeJs, my role initially in this project will be to make sure there are no doubts regarding the foundation of these areas - neither for me nor anyone else in the group. 


### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I still feel like this is hard to reflect upon now, since we are all still in the initial phase of understanding scrum.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means 
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down 
what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, 
concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you 
would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by 
motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s 
each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the 
outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### From previous week
- I have gotten a better understanding of scrum, after reading theory about it on the internet. This has mostly been the basic concepts and why scrum is an appropriate way of working.


#### For the next week
- During this upcoming week I will concentrate on reading about NodeJS and Javascript, on a basic level - which will give me more information of which areas I need to focus extra on.

# Week 3

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to get better understanding of Android Studio and all the connection that still isn't working for me. I get a lot of help from my team, but I also need to make an effort to really understand how everything connects.
- There is still a lot to learn within JavaScript, since I don't have any practical experience in this language. This will probably be more clear once we start with the actual coding - but I will keep reading guides and information about JavaScript, to keep learning.
- After the meeting with the Tug Boat Operator I have come to the understanding that I also need to get a closer look at the different connections that is available through PortCDM, which the group also will work with during the next week.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since there are more people in the group who has problems with connections and different downloads of the programs, I want to make sure I remember the different procedures in case someone else has the same problem later. 


### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I have been involved in the reflections we have had during this last week, where we have restructured our work to make more efficient concerning contact with PO.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### From the previous week
- From last week I have done some reading and gone through "beginner guides" etc, to learn more about JavaScript. I feel like I have a better understanding, but as I said earlier it is still a lot to learn, ofcourse. This will be an ongoing process during the course, since I will learn more the longer we work with it.


#### For the next weeks
- As stated, JavaScript is a big part and I want to make sure I really understand all the code that is written.
- There are still programs and parts of the developing environment that I don't understand, even though I have a better overview now than in the beginning. This will also be an ongoing process, until everything is clear to me.

# Week 4
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Now I feel like I have a good overview of what is expected from the group in the overall project, and also roughly what the Tugboat Operator values in the app. This is a good foundation for the further development of the app, and for me the next step is to get an even better understanding of the underlying code that we should change and update to achive the goals we have set up through the user stories.
- During this sprint I am going to write my first code that will actually give value to the user, and therefore I want to (and will) learn more about JavaScript through the practice it gives.


### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- The best way to share my knowledge this week will be to discuss the solutions that me and my partner this week, in the pair programming, will come up with. We basically have the same backgrpund in programming so I think we can learn a lot by sharing our concerns and problems that come up during the sprint.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- Last week I wasn't very active in the project since I was away on vacation, which have to change during this week. I still finished the task I was assigned last week but this week I will put more work hours in the project to make up for last week.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

#### From last week
- Last week I wanted to understand the connections between the programmes used for the development, which I have. Android studio is up and running for me and I've learned how the different programmes work.
- I also said I wanted to know about the Tug Boat operator and his view of the project and the app. I participated in the first meeting with him which gave me an understanding of his thoughts.

#### For the next week
-- For next week my main focus is JavaScript and development by actual code writing. I'm sure I will learn a lot from using JavaScript and discuss the solution with my partner.


#### For the next weeks
- My main goal with this project is to get an understanding of a software development project and problems, possibilites and knowledge that comes with it. I don't think I will be able to development all the different parts of the project (eg. server, database, modules etc) but the most important part for me is to see the connections and being able to use the knowledge in projects later in my career (and in school)
