### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means 
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down 
what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, 
concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you 
would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by 
motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s 
each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the 
outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.

Week 1


### What do I want to learn or understand better?
-       I need a better overview over the workflow, scrum and the project itself.
-       There are also a few communication channels that are new to me, and I want to understand them better and see the structure of them, together.
-       I want to understand both how scrum works in theory and how it could be used in this project
-       In order to get a better overview, I need to get more information about the “coding parts” of the project, to learn more within that area.




### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-       My hopes is that I can develop my management skills as one of three scrum masters, and also to contribute with these skills to help organize workflow and work tasks within the group.




### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
-   	So far I don’t have enough information and knowledge of Scrum to comment this much further, however, I will make sure I am up to date with deadlines, sprints and work tasks to help develop the project.




### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means

each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the 
outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### For the next week
During the following week I aim to:
-  	Understand Scrum, both theoretical and also how Scrum could be useful in this particular problem
- 	Be well aware of what is expected from a Scrum master
- 	Understand the project, the code foundation that is needed and the customer’s wishes as well as what I need to get more knowledge within to contribute to the project and the development of code.
- 	Feel comfortable with the project structure, in order to see what natural steps should be taken further on.


Week 2


### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to get a basic insight of NodeJS and JavaScript, which are both new to me. This will be acomplished by reading beginner guides and overviews of how they are used and also how they could contribute to efficiency in our project.
- There is still a lot I can learn and understand when it comes to scrum, and mainly the practical use of it. Until now I have read a lot of theory about it but still have a lot of learn when it comes to actually implement it in a project.
- Something I need to constantly think about during the project is to always double check or ask for help when it comes to areas I previously haven't worked with, to make sure both me and the group get the best possible outcome of the project and the course.


### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since I don't have any experience with javascript oc NodeJs, my role initially in this project will be to make sure there are no doubts regarding the foundation of these areas - neither for me nor anyone else in the group. 


### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I still feel like this is hard to reflect upon now, since we are all still in the initial phase of understanding scrum.


### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means 
that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down 
what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, 
concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you 	would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.


#### From previous week
- I have gotten a better understanding of scrum, after reading theory about it on the internet. This has mostly been the basic concepts and why scrum is an appropriate way of working.


#### For the next week
- During this upcoming week I will concentrate on reading about NodeJS and Javascript, on a basic level - which will give me more information of which areas I need to focus extra on.
