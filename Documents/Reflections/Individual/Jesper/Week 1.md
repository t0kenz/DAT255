## Reflections each week by Jesper

### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I've worked with similar, much simpler project structures before like Kanban and really like the idea of scrum. I look forward to increase my understanding in the scrum concept and learn how I can take this knowledge and use it in future projects.
- I want to learn how to work effective in a big group and learn how to use each members strength to contribute to a good project, while also learning from their strength.
- I want to get a better understanding on how to structure a project from scratch
- I want to learn the different strengths of my team’s members

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Our group has a broad knowledge base, but in different aspects. I think that one of my strengths is knowledge of backend coding and database structures and I hope that I can share this knowledge with our team. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As of now it's hard to tell how I'll contribution towards our team’s application of scrum since we haven't had the chance yet to implement it in our project. But I do know that I'll complete my tasks to the best of my ability and help our team to complete our tasks.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For the next week
- Get a good understanding of how scrum works.
- Understand how softwares like git/trello can increase the efficiency of a project
- Get a good feel for the codebase, and if it's a coding language I'm unfamiliar with I'll look into the basics of that language
