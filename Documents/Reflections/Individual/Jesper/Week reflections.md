## Reflections each week by Jesper
# Week 9 (last reflection)
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Scrum. I want to learn how to apply scrum in future projects and take advandage of knowing what is the most important to do, and when to do it. I want to be better at slicing problems into smaller tasks, tasks that have value for the project and its owner. I need to remember that keeping a good communication with the project owner is important for both of us, and a key in applying scrum. However, I will not use all of scrums practises for the next project since I'm the only person in the project, and have to report to several product owners. But I've noticed that it happens that I focuses on the wrong implementations and spend my time on less valuable tasks. This is where I will be focusing my application of scrum, doing sprints with tasks from a board filled with user stories, and their importance and velocity.
- If I were to continue in this project I would need to spend more time understanding how the internal components of react work. How to keep the structural model of the code base, and how to work with how it stores data and moves them between states. I feel like I've learned a lot of react during this course, but still have a lot to learn if I want to continue develop within this coding language.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- As I said in the first reflection, our group had a broad knowledge base, but in different aspects. Five of the members have an background in computer science, and three in industrial engineering. With this in mind we tried to use every members strength when we could. For example I had a lot of experience with programming and not so much knowledge in communication and product management. I had to learn how to be better at communication with the product owner/operator, but helped other members with programming and programming strucure/guidelines.
- I will continue to learn by other peoples strengths and sharing my strengths in future project, this way every one in the team gets better. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- For the last sprints we've had a lot pressure to get a dynamic application, and not just static. We wanted to be able to show live information about portcalls and its details. To complete this we had a lot of focus on dividing user strories into small valuable tasks. Each task would contribute to our final review. I tried to make sure that we divided our stories well enought, but some remained really big (1 / 5th of our entire sprint in velocity). Since I felt comfortable with coding and the code base I took some of the bigger tasks so we could get an even better final product. 

- I delivered my part of the sprint, and most of our team also did. This felt really good, because now we had something to show to the product owners. We made a compromise with them about what's a possible end product for us, and we delivered what was asked from us!

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
- My goals from last week where to complete my tasks, help other complete their tasks and have a good final application for our final review. I also have had a goal for the last weeks to keep vertical slicing our user stories into small valuable
tasks. I managed to complete my tasks, and even help other complete theirs during this last sprint. I felt that we presented a good appliction for the final review and we got a lot of positive feedback from the product owners and other groups. Sure, there where things we would have liked to add to our application. But given the time left and our circumstances I feel like we did a great job. 

-In the future I would like to be more prepared for the final sprint and have less to complete, this time we had to implement tons of new features and debug them at the same time. That's not optimal. This led to us having some bugs in the background of the application that would eat our memory and after 10-15 minutes of running the application would get markedly slower, and with no time to fix the problem we just had to keep the bug. To ensure this doesn't happen in future projects I think that it's good to set a base for how to structure code and what tools to use when debugging. And before a task is done, it should go through some debugging tests. But even with this we would still have a problem with having to much todo during the last sprint. I think that this a common issue among most projects, and there is no simple fix for it. But with better time manangement and keeping the tasks vertical it will not be as big of a problem since each tasks has value for the application and if you don't have time to complete all tasks, you still contributed value to the project.


# Week 8
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- For this course's last sprint I feel that I have a good understanding of our project, and its codebase. I think that I can use 100% of my focus implementing new features for the comming sprint, so we have a complete product with good value for the project owners for our last review. This sprint I need to focus on priority and understand what feature has the most value right now, and implement that and only that feature. Then move on to the next task with a high value. I need to continue to do this for the entire sprint, completing small but valueable tasks and not split my focus on several tasks at once.  
- Scrum feels more at home now. I feel like I understand the concept and workflow. However I feel like its still really hard to predict/"guess" the velocity of a task. We've only been able to accurately guess the velocity a few times, and those tasks where guessed accurately because of it was similar to something I've done before. I think that the only way to get better at predicting the velocity of a task is by practise, and reflecting on the predictions outcome. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- For this last sprint I will atend all our meetings and be active in them. Only a few of us can build and run the application, so we will need to program in bigger groups of 3-4, which is not optimal. Since I've a lot of experience within javascript I will help me team with solving common issues (like complex async problems) whenever it's needed, and hopefully make our team better at javascript.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- Even with last weeks objective in mind (to slice our big tasks into small, but still vertical tasks) we still have a problem with slicing tasks to big. We did put more effort in our last slicing session and the tasks did indeed get smaller. But some of the tasks where still to big for us to comfortably say that we'll be able to complete them within a sprint. To address this we will have to put even more effort into the slicing to get achievable tasks.
- I will also atend and be active on all our the remaining meetings so we can deliver a good product for our product owners, and for our selfs. I will actively try to pick the task with most value so we can deliver a complete product, and not just a concept.  

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- I delivered my part of the sprint, and most of our team also did. This felt really good, because now we had something to show to the product owners. We made a compromise with them about what's a possible end product for us, and now it's up to us to make sure we deliver what we promised.

#### For the next week
- For the next sprint I will try to split our tasks to even smaller tasks, while still trying to keep them vertical. I also aim to fully complete my tasks and help my team complete theirs, and sort them by product owner value. As of now, only 3 out of 8 in our team can get the project to work on their computers. This means that we will have to code in bigger groups to make every member able to accomplish their tasks and to contribut to the team. This will also slow our progress and now it's even more important to slice tasks into realistic tasks with a correct estimate for velocity, so we dont take on more than we can handle. My primary focus for next week will be to complete all my tasks and contribute to us having a good application that we're happy to present to the product owners.

# Week 7
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I feel comfortable programming in the project and the code base is no longer unfamiliar. I feel like I've made progress within the application and acheived something of value. During the past week I spent a lot of my time learning the different API's of the server and learned how to extract the information we need for our application. This included implementing some new request to the server, which also went fine. My next goal within programming in this application is to get a hold of all the different internal states and make the compucations async. I will do this by learning how states/components work in react native (ComponentWillMount for example) and apply it to our already existing code. Not only to make it faster and more secure, but also to follow the existing code bases structure.
- Scrum feels more at home now. I feel like I understand the concept and workflow. However I feel like its really hard to predict/"guess" the velocity of a task. We've only been able to accurately guess the velocity a few times, and those tasks where guessed accurately because of it was similar to something I've done before. I think that the only way to get better at predicting the velocity of a task is by practise, and reflecting on the predictions outcome. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I have written a lot of code within the application and I hope that I'll able to help our team solve problems if they're similar to the problems I faced. I will attend to all the meetings when I can, I'll also attend our group programming sessions where I will share the problems I found and listen to the rest of our teams problems and we'll work out a solution. (I refer problem to a challange within the coding of our application) 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- Even with last weeks objective in mind (to slice our big tasks into small, but still vertical tasks) we still have a problem with slicing tasks to big. We did put more effort in our last slicing session and the tasks did indeed get smaller.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- It felt really bad that we did not have anything of value to show to our product owners the last sprint. So during this sprint I tried to accomplish my tasks within the sprint, which I also did manage to accomplish. During this sprint I had to realize that I dont have that much time to spend on this course and break down my tasks accordingly. The breakdown went good but I still felt that we had to big tasks which is something I hope to fix for our next sprint.   

#### For the next week
- For the next sprint I will try to split our tasks to even smaller tasks, while still trying to keep them vertical. I also aim to fully complete my tasks and help my team complete theirs, if a problem arises. As of now, only 4 out of 8 in our team can get the project to work on their computers. This means that we will have to code in bigger groups to make every member able to accomplish their tasks and to contribut to the team. 

# Week 6
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I feel like I have an understanding of the codebase and how its strucutred now. And scrum feels more at home, however I still have to learn a lot in Scrum to be able to use it in future projects. To get better at scrum I will continue to be active during meetings and reflect our thoughts with our teachers.
- As of now I have some basic knowledge of the APIs that portCDM uses and supports. We have looked into how to extract the information we need for our remodeled version of the application. I still need to look into how to request information to our server from portCDM with the correct credentials and how to refactor the informtion into our database and clients. I will try to learn how to refactor the requests and update our database/clients by first looking at what's that we need from this requests, and then try to refactor them.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- As of now, some members in our team have some problems with Android and getting it to run with the changes that has been made to the codebase, I will try to help them out and share the steps I took to get it to work for me.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- We have a problem with vertical slicing our problems into good tasks, they seem to get to big and the tasks has a high rate of failure in them. I hope that for the next sprint we'll be more thorough when creating vertical tasks, and I will do my best to keep them small and easy to implement. This is so we dont run into the chance of having a sprint review without anything to show.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- I did not deliver the tasks that I took on during the last sprint. This is mostly because of bad planing of the velocity beforehand and also that we had a holiday in the middle of the sprint. I overestimated the amount of time I would be able to spend and underestimated the time it would take to complete the tasks. We could not show our product owner anything of value due to this. 

#### For the next week
- In the future I will try to be more realistic with how much time I can spend on this course, but also the amount of time (velocity) it takes to get a task done. I will try to splice the tasks into smaller tasks, while still trying to make them valuable for the product owner.

# Week 4/5 (We swapped dates to match the PO review)
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I need to look into how we can communicate between our server and portCDM's. This is done over http requests and I need to read up on portCDM's API and how we can receive/post the information we need.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I will try to help my team with how http requests work. If there's uncertainty within the backend and how it works I will also try to help my team to understand it. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- I've been active during all the meetings I've been able to atend. I've also atended both meetings with our operator and been active during those meetings aswell. I've used my knowledge from nodeJS projects combined with what our PO/Operator want from the application and have helped our team to create userstories that is valuable for the PO and the Operator.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- I still have a lot to learn within scrum and the this week we got a short but valuable talk with our Product Owner and got some great ideas for the application. We got our first real feeling what scrum actually is like.
#### For the next week
- As mentioned earlier we got some great ideas when talking to the PO. But we need to make certain that we dont bite off more than we can chew, we need to be able to deliver a good product and not just a lot of ideas that never got implemented. To acheive this I will try to get a grip on what's actually manageable for us to achieve within 5 weeks, and only implement the most important parts.



# Week 3 (Late update due to meeting with PO on Sunday)
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- After spending some time with the code base it's clear that I'll need a lot more time to fully understand it and be able to produce code that's similar to the already written code.
- I need to look into vertical slicing within scrum and learn how to apply it in real world scenarios, which we will start to do on monday and wednesday the following week.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Since I've gotten the code to run on my computer I will be able to help if someone gets stuck on the same problems as I did. I will also try to explain the code base to anyone of my team if they have a hard time understanding how it all works. I've spent a lot of time this week to learn how to write React code (the library that the program uses) and will try to help my team if they have trouble getting started
- When we try to slice the epics from our scrum board I will try to use my knowledge of producing nodeJS code and help with an accurate time estimate for each user story.v


### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- So far I have been active on most of our team's meetings and have also been active in the discussions outside meetings, for example how to use most of git's built in features to streamline our teams progress.
- For now it's hard to say how I will contribute to our application of scrum more that beeing active in the progress of making our application and how we should apply scrum.

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### From the previous week
- I have spent a lot of time getting the application to run on my computer. I've used this knowledge to help the other members in our team to get the application to run on their computers.
- I still have a lot to learn within scrum and the last week we got a short talk with our Product Owner to get a feel what's asked from us.
- I have watched some youtube lectures to better understand how React (The library that the code base uses) works and how to apply it. I feel like I'm ready to start producing code, however I still need to spend more time with our code base to write code that matched the previous code.

#### For the next week
- I will continue to learn about Scrum and I still need more skill within React. I feel like I still need to spend more time with the existing code to understand how it's written and what patterns the use. 
- During the next week we will start replan our epics and slice them up into smaller pieces. I will try to be active in this to get a better understanding on how to slice user stories/epics up and still keep some value for the PO.




# Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- Have have a broad knowledge of NodeJS and javascript but I need to read into the specifics of the project, more specific what kind libraries we will use and how they work.
- I will look into gradle and research how grade will be impemented in our project to increase our efficiency. I will do this by reading guides on gradle and also looking through gradle's websites documentation.
- I still need to learn more about scrum and how to apply it in a project.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I want to help my team with sharing my experience and knowledge of NodeJS. For example what programs that works well with NodeJS and what plugins I use to follow standard guidelines. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- So far my contribution of our scrum has been low, but it'll increase during next week when we start planing our project. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For previous weeks
- I've read a lot of documentation about scrum and feel that I still have much to learn within scrum, and see it in practise.
- I still want to learn how to work effective in a big group and still need to get to know my fellow team members better.
#### For next week
- For the following weeks I will need to read the code base of the project and code from my team so I get a good knowledge of the program we're building.
- I also want to get to know the product owners view of our project aswell as talking to a person working within the branch.





# Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I've worked with similar, much simpler project structures before like Kanban and really like the idea of scrum. I look forward to increase my understanding in the scrum concept and learn how I can take this knowledge and use it in future projects.
- I want to learn how to work effective in a big group and learn how to use each members strength to contribute to a good project, while also learning from their strength.
- I want to get a better understanding on how to structure a project from scratch
- I want to learn the different strengths of my team’s members

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Our group has a broad knowledge base, but in different aspects. I think that one of my strengths is knowledge of backend coding and database structures and I hope that I can share this knowledge with our team. 

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- As of now it's hard to tell how I'll contribution towards our team’s application of scrum since we haven't had the chance yet to implement it in our project. But I do know that I'll complete my tasks to the best of my ability and help our team to complete our tasks.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation.
#### For next week
- Get a good understanding of how scrum works. I will do this by rechecking the lectures and read literature about scrum.
- Understand how softwares like git/trello can increase the efficiency of a project.
- Get a good feel for the codebase, and if it's a coding language I'm unfamiliar with I'll look into the basics of that language
