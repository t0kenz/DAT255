# Week 7

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

The Scrum philosophy of trying things out and not planning too long ahead. This hasn't been applied enough during the project. We will need to do this during the remaining two weeks.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will be working with a new programming partner this sprint (we are switching partners due to some people having problems with building the app on their computers). I will discuss the process of pair programming and programming in general with them and see if we can learn something from discussing our previous experiences and working with each other.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

I brought up the fact that we lacked frequent communication about our progress. Consequently we added requirements about providing status updates via Slack twice per week in addition to the meetings.

I also pointed out the issue that we weren't taking detailed enough meeting notes. We therefore decided to have a secretary for each meeting, to make sure decisions, progress reports etc are well documented.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

Task planning:
We completed our assigned tasks. However, we ended up without a lot to do at the end of the sprint. Maybe we were a bit too cautious about taking on more tasks? It seems a lot of practice is needed to learn to get sprint estimation right.

My learning objectives for the next week are:

Until now I may have been too worried about the implementation details. I will attempt to work more incrementally and not think too much about the end result until it's necessary. This includes using placeholders when appropriate and pushing often to our repo.


# Week 6

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

I want to get better at creating tasks and estimating their velocity. This week almost none of our team's tasks were finished, but a lot of them were almost done. Maybe we could have more of them done if we had broken them down differently and/or taken on fewer tasks. This was likely somewhat related to the May 1st holiday, even though we tried to take it into account when planning the sprint.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will upload some of the code we have used for testing our tasks to the team repository, probably as a separate file with helper functions and examples. E.g. code to connect to our server from within the app.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

I have participated in all team meetings and made significant progress on our assigned tasks together with my programming partner.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

1: Pair programming:
This week's pair programming has gone really well. I spent maybe 90% of my time working with my programming parter. It feels like we have gotten more done than we would have separately, probably partly because our tasks were not entirely clear in how they should be done. This required us to do a lot of discussing and exploring the options. Also, having a second person present lets you catch a lot of errors right right away. Errors that one person might overlook because they are juggling several different parts of the code in their head and miss some details.


2: Learn more about the app and JavaScript in general:
This week I have prioritized our assigned tasks, which have taken up all of my time allocated for the course. Therefore I haven't done any real learning outside of what was required for moving forward with the tasks. I feel like my knowledge has been enough to get things done, so I don't consider this a huge failure. With this in mind, I will drop this goal for now.


My learning objectives for the next week are:

After last week's failure in getting tasks completed, I will try to plan our work and estimate task velocity so that we can get most (preferably all) our assigned tasks done during the sprint. We will need to define the tasks so that we can work in a way where we don't end up with a lot of them almost done like last week.


# Week 5

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●How to use pair programming in a productive way.

●How our app will communicate with our server and the portCDM backend, including how to write JavaScript code for network communication.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●I can share what I learn about the networking part during my work on related tasks.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

● I have participated in all group meetings (except with the tugboat operator) and worked with my tasks according to the agreed upon workflow.

## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

1: "Continue to learn about the codebase, tools and JS by working on my assigned tasks during our first sprint.":

This went as planned. My tasks were small enough to allow me to spend lots of time on learning more about the above.

2: "...learn as much as possible from the first sprint. This will be achieved through participating in the upcoming sprint and reflecting on it continuously (i.e. I need to keep the process in mind and not just focus on the coding).": 

Due to how we divided the work, I was unable to get a partner to work with. Consequently I have worked on my own during this sprint.
Our Monday meeting where we quickly went through the three daily standup questions went very well. We managed to keep it below 30 minutes, which is a lot faster than the typical meeting in any project course I have taken. Imposing a time limit and having a pre-defined set of questions makes the meeting a lot more efficient. One problem that I have noticed a lot in other meetings which this prevents very well is the tendency for people to feel the need to follow every thread of discussion to the end, right away, even when it doesn't concern that many meeting participants. Having a plan that forces people to save such discussions for later and in smaller groups helps a lot with efficiency. This is probably the most important lesson from this sprint.

My learning objectives for the next week are:

1: I feel like pair programming in other courses has varied a lot in how useful it has been. I would like to learn more about how to do it successfully. I will do some pair programming and reflect on the process.

2: I still need to learn more about how the app works as well as improve my JavaScript skills.  I will achieve this by trying to get a bit of a broader knowledge than just the parts I will work on for my assigned tasks by trying things out in the app and reading up more on JavaScript.

# Week 4 

This was a shorter week due to a change in our scheduling: sprints are now Thur-Wed. Consequently some objectives are unchanged from last week, as we have not completed our first sprint. The previous reflection was written expecting to go through the first sprint before writing this reflection. Week 4 covers Sat 14th - Wed 18th.

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better? (unchanged since last week)

●The project codebase, JavaScript, the development tools (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

●Sprint planning and execution.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●Once I learn more about the codebase, as I work on my tasks, I can discuss it with the group and we can help each other fill in any gaps in our understanding.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I have participated in group meetings and completed my assigned task to prepare for our first sprint.

## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

Regarding the codebase, tools and JS, I have done what was planned the week before. 
The sprint-related goal has not been achieved because we haven't started the first sprint yet, due to the schedule change.

My learning objectives for the next week are:

1: Continue to learn about the codebase, tools and JS by working on my assigned tasks during our first sprint.

2: Same as last week: learn as much as possible from the first sprint. This will be achieved through participating in the upcoming sprint and reflecting on it continuously (i.e. I need to keep the process in mind and not just focus on the coding).


# Week 3
## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●The project codebase, JavaScript, the development tools (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

●Sprint planning and execution.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●I spent a lot of time getting the project to run, so I should be able to help anyone who still has problems (at least on linux)


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I participated in most group meetings including the Friday meeting where we wrote the reflection and made some improvements to the user stories.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

●Scrum: we further developed the user stories after some feedback. The first user stories were too large, and lacked motivation.

●JavaScript, nodeJS, Gradle: did some reading and tried writing some code. However I still need to improve my JavaScript skills.

●Project: I had a look at the codebase. However it was not well documented and my lack of JavaScript knowledge didn't help. Also, I spent a lot of time just getting the project to run, which left me with less time than expected to spend on other goals. Consequently I do not feel that I understand the codebase well enough.
 
My learning objectives for the next week are:

Next week I will primarily focus on understanding the codebase, familiarizing myself with the development tools, and further improving my JavaScript skills enough to be able to contribute during the first sprint. To achieve this I will do some reading and trying things out. In the project I will get an overview of the different components, then start modifying the current app, starting with very basic changes and make them more advanced as I improve my understanding.
  
The second goal is to get my first real experience of performing a sprint, and learn as much as possible from it. This will be achieved through participating in the upcoming sprint and reflecting on it continuously (i.e. I need to keep the process in mind and not just focus on the coding).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Week 2
## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●JavaScript, nodejs, gradle. Since we will use these in the project I need to learn more.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●This week we are focusing on learning the above technologies, which I have very little experience with. I can assist others with similar or no experience by sharing learning resources that I find helpful.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I did some reading and attended this week's meeting where we discussed how to create user stories and how to use Trello for our Scrum board.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:

●Scrum: I have made some progress, but there will be more opportunity for learning when we get started on really preparing for the first sprint.

●Git: Similar to the above, we haven't really gotten started on using Git other than for reflections. More learning opportunities will come when the sprints start. I will therefore not focus on this during the coming week.

●Teamwork: There were still some people using Facebook for communication after the group Slack was set up. I made sure to encourage them to exclusively use Slack, which helps with organizing the group. I realized that when introducing something new like Slack, you have to follow up and make sure people make the change, and help them with the basics if necessary. 
This week's meeting was only attended by five people, so the meeting ran smoothly. Therefore I don't have any observations of possible meeting improvements. However I expect that it will be important to have a clear agenda prepared before the meeting, and try to follow it. We only have one meeting next week (re-exam week) and I may not be able to attend all of it, so I will drop this point as an objective and probably pick it up again when the sprints start.

My main learning objectives for the next week are:

●Scrum: do some more work on user stories based on the provided scenario.

●JavaScript, nodeJS, Gradle: do some reading and work through some tutorial(s) to improve my knowledge.

●Project: start looking at the code base for the existing app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Week 1

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●Scrum. I have no previous experience. The next big step in the learning process will be to create user stories and tasks after we get our assignment.

●Git. So far I have only used very basic commands in my project courses. The group size and weekly delivery schedule of this course will likely require me to learn more.

●How to make such a large group run smoothly. This is the largest group I have worked in (previously up to 6 members), so we will need to learn e.g. how to divide responsibilities and how to have efficient meetings.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●I'm currently using Trello to track tasks (though not following Scrum) in my Bachelor's Thesis group. This experience might be useful when we start using Trello for this project.

●I should also be ready to help the group members who have less programming experience with any questions they might have.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I created a Trello board for the team to use as a Scrum task board.

●I attended all lectures, exercises and group meetings.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

●Scrum: I will do some more reading (and go through the lecture slides and notes again), to prepare for our planning session after we receive our assignment.

● Git: I will do some reading and probably work through a tutorial.

●"Large group teamwork" – I will keep this in mind during the work week and note things that could be improved upon.
