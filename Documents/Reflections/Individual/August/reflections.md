# Week 2
## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●JavaScript, nodejs, gradle. Since we will use these in the project I need to learn more.

## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●This week we are focusing on learning the above technologies, which I have very little experience with. I can assist others with similar or no experience by sharing learning resources that I find helpful.

## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I did some reading and attended this week's meeting where we discussed how to create user stories and how to use Trello for our Scrum board.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

Since last week:
●Scrum: I have made some progress, but there will be more opportunity for learning when we get started on really preparing for the first sprint.
●Git: Similar to the above, we haven't really gotten started on using Git other than for reflections. More learning opportunities will come when the sprints start. I will therefore not focus on this during the coming week.
●Teamwork: There were still some people using Facebook for communication after the group Slack was set up. I made sure to encourage them to exclusively use Slack, which helps with organizing the group. I realized that when introducing something new like Slack, you have to follow up and make sure people make the change, and help them with the basics if necessary. 
This week's meeting was only attended by five people, so the meeting ran smoothly. Therefore I don't have any observations of possible meeting improvements. However I expect that it will be important to have a clear agenda prepared before the meeting, and try to follow it. We only have one meeting next week (re-exam week) and I may not be able to attend all of it, so I will drop this point as an objective and probably pick it up again when the sprints start.

My main learning objectives for the next week are:
●Scrum: do some more work on user stories based on the provided scenario.
●JavaScript, nodeJS, Gradle: do some reading and work through some tutorial(s) to improve my knowledge.
●Project: start looking at the code base for the existing app.

# Week 1

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●Scrum. I have no previous experience. The next big step in the learning process will be to create user stories and tasks after we get our assignment.

●Git. So far I have only used very basic commands in my project courses. The group size and weekly delivery schedule of this course will likely require me to learn more.

●How to make such a large group run smoothly. This is the largest group I have worked in (previously up to 6 members), so we will need to learn e.g. how to divide responsibilities and how to have efficient meetings.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●I'm currently using Trello to track tasks (though not following Scrum) in my Bachelor's Thesis group. This experience might be useful when we start using Trello for this project.

●I should also be ready to help the group members who have less programming experience with any questions they might have.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I created a Trello board for the team to use as a Scrum task board.

●I attended all lectures, exercises and group meetings.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

●Scrum: I will do some more reading (and go through the lecture slides and notes again), to prepare for our planning session after we receive our assignment.

● Git: I will do some reading and probably work through a tutorial.

●"Large group teamwork" – I will keep this in mind during the work week and note things that could be improved upon.
