# Week 1

## 1. What do I want to learn or understand better?

●Scrum. I have no previous experience. The next big step in the learning process will be to create user stories and tasks after we get our assignment.

●Git. So far I have only used very basic commands in my project courses. The group size and weekly delivery schedule of this course will likely require me to learn more.

●How to make such a large group run smoothly. This is the largest group I have worked in (previously up to 6 members), so we will need to learn e.g. how to divide responsibilities and how to have efficient meetings.


## 2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

●I'm currently using Trello to track tasks (though not following Scrum) in my Bachelor's Thesis group. This experience might be useful when we start using Trello for this project.

●I should also be ready to help the group members who have less programming experience with any questions they might have.


## 3. What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

●I created a Trello board for the team to use as a Scrum task board.

●I attended all lectures, exercises and group meetings.


## 4. What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week’s ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation)

My learning objectives are:

●Scrum: I will do some more reading (and go through the lecture slides and notes again), to prepare for our planning session after we receive our assignment.

● Git: I will do some reading and probably work through a tutorial.

●"Large group teamwork" – I will keep this in mind during the work week and note things that could be improved upon.
