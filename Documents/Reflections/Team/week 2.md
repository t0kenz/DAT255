# Week 2

## 1. The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- We will create an application designed for a towage operator. The full scope and the priority of features have not yet been decided as we have not had a meeting with the product owner yet. 
- The aim of the application we’ll develop is to meet the product owner’s needs by providing the most necessary features and time-stamp information. 
- To be able to reach this aim, our main concerns are at the moment to discuss the requirements with the towage operator, get a better understanding of the current app code as well as the provided scenario. 

## 2. Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week 
-   At the moment the social contract has been established. We have identified some problems regarding how we should use our scrum board and that it’s inefficient to have a rotating scrum master because this person will communicate with other groups.
    
-   We have decided that we will have a permanent scrum master to solve the issue of continuity in communicating with other groups.
    
-   It's important to constantly reflect upon the social contract in order to coordinate our work within in the team in a better way.

## 3. The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
-   As of yet we do not know enough about the requirements of the application and therefore we can not define the success criteria
    
-   To be able to define the success criteria we will therefore have to talk to the product owner and later decide on what the success criteria should be.

## 4. Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
-   As of yet we have not had any acceptance tests but we assume as of right now that they will be checked during peer code review where we check each others code.
    
-   We are however not completely sure about the meaning of acceptance tests and will therefore have to ask or read more about acceptance tests to get a better understanding of this point.

## 5. The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)
-   We have not yet researched the structure of the available source code and can not say much about the current design
    
-   We will have to look through the codebase to say more on this topic

## 6. The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
-   Same as question 5

## 7. The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
-   Same as question 5

## 8. Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
-   We have currently decided on a pattern for user stories. One whole story will be labeled with a number x and a colour. The following subtasks will then be labeled with the same colour and subnumbers (i.e x.1, x.2 and so forth). The user stories and subtasks will also be marked with expected velocities.
    
-   We have also created a structure for effort estimation in terms of a burn up-chart which measures velocity. Our current target velocity is 80 points on average each week which corresponds to 10 points per person on average each week.
    
-   In order to establish good user stories we need to have all of this in place.
    
-   During the upcoming two weeks we need to create a structure for acceptance criterias and task breakdown. This will be more simple to do once we have some user stories from owner product owner that could be broken down into specific tasks.



## 9. The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress

-   Our three KPIs are
    

### Burn up chart (accepted velocity vs points taken)
    

-   One problem we might have is estimating the velocity correctly which might lead to us taking more or less points than we can handle. We will solve this by logging the amount of points we complete each sprint and compare it to the current estimated velocity so that we know if we have to change our velocity. With this KPI we will also be able to tell if our ability to estimate velocity changes. Our goal is to make the gap between estimated velocity and completed points per sprint smaller.
    
-   We have decided that the targeted velocity is 80 points each week which corresponds to 10 points per person on average each week.
    

### Code Coverage in %
    

-   Another issue might be to know how much of our code is correct. To solve this we will log the percentage of code that is covered by unit tests. We want to have as high code coverage as possible and at least cover 70% of the code, with an exception for uncheckable code such as UI.
    

###   Code deletion
    

-   The final thing that we are looking at is deletion of code which generally implies that the planning phase was not extensive enough. We will therefore measure the amount of code deleted by lines commited to git, so that we know if we write unnecessary code. If we see that a lot of code is getting deleted we will know that we have to plan more before we code. This way we will not spend too much time at writing code that will not get used.
    
-   The target of this KPI will be set during the first work week..

## 10. Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself
- No code has been written yet

## 11. The roles you have used within the team
-   We’ve established two roles within the group. Last week we decided that the scrum master role will rotate among three individuals of the group. We have come to the conclusion that this is a bad solution because the scrum master will handle the inter-group communication. The other role we’ve established, which regards everyone in the group, is that each group member will review another group member’s code.
    
-   It’s important to create a good role distribution in order to balance the work time among the group
    
-   To solve the problem with the scrum master we’ve decided that only one person will be scrum master. To insure that we constantly follow up on our KPI we have made three members in charge of one KPI each.

## 12. The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
-   We have a solid base for continuous reflection in terms of these questions. This will make it possible to be agile and constantly handle changes in our group dynamic, change requests from the product owner and other changes.
    
-   The aim is to always reflect upon our work and tackle the issues and changes that we have identified.
    
-   At the moment we’ve made some role changes, standardized our use of the scrum board and developed our KPIs. In order to reach our aim we need to continue to reflect on a weekly basis, keep in touch with our product owner and make sure that everytime we identify a problem we need to address a solution to that problem.

## 13. The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
-   Week 1 - 12h - 14h (lectures + meeting + individual reflection).
    
-   Week 2 - 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.5 (lectures + meeting + individual reflection).
    
-   The above does not include individual time spent on e.g. reading course material.
    
-   In the coming weeks every group member will fill in how much time they have spent. We will then calculate an average based on that data.

## 14. The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
- We have not had a review yet.

## 15. Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
-   We use git for version control and github as a repository. We use Trello for our scrum board. We use Slack for general conversations and Google Drive for simultaneous work such as our group reflection.
    
-   In order to keep our work efficient and to create a good working environment we need to not only choose the best tools for our work but also established best practices for how to use those tools. This will be done by constantly reflecting about our current choice and use of tools.
    
-   We have decided on some best practices when it comes to using trello (scrum) which is how we will label our user stories and how we will use them (see point 8).
    
-   We’ve established a git-workflow that we’ll follow in order to deal with merge issues and similar problems. It can be found in the documents in the github-repo.
    
-   The git-workflow is subject to change and has not been completed.
    
-   We haven’t yet decided on an IDE and to be able to do this, we must further research the available source code and see what practices are used in the existing project.

## 16. Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say
-   Our insights about what we should accomplish are based on the lecture hosted by RISE Viktoria. We now have a better understanding of what we should do in terms of a specific app for towage operators and we have received insights about what we need to learn more about in order to build a successful application.
    
-   Our current usage of Scrum is primarily based on the Scrum lectures and exercises.
