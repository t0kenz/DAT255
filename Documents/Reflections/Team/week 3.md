# Week 3

### 1. The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- We will create an application designed for a towage operator. The full scope and the priority of features have not yet been decided as we have not had a meeting with the product owner yet. The meeting will take room next week. 
- The aim of the application we’ll develop is to meet the product owner’s needs by providing the most necessary features and time-stamp information. 
- To be able to reach this aim, our main concerns are at the moment to discuss the requirements with the towage operator, get a better understanding of the current app code as well as the provided scenario. 

### 2. Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week 
- The social contract has been updated with new fixed meeting days and times; mondays 9.30-10.00 (daily scrum), wednesdays 12-17 (review and retrospective) and thursdays 9-11 (sprint planning). We have also decided that we will try pair programming when appropriate. This is due to the code being hard to understand and we think that teams of two will have a greater efficiency producing good code. When confronted with a larger problem, the team member is obligated to upload this problem to "Issues" on GitHub as the same problem might arise for another member of the team.

### 3. The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
- One identified success criteria is that we need to cooperate with other course groups, especially the agent-teams, in order to get the information we need to develop the application for the tug boat operator. We’ll try to do this during the Scrum of Scrums meetings and in the Slack channel of the course. 
- Another success criteria is to clearly determine the scope of the application which we’ll be able to do by communicate with the product owner and the tug boat operator. 
- To be able to define more success criterias we will have to talk to the product owner and later decide on what the success criteria should be.

### 4. Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
- As of yet we have not had any acceptance tests but we assume as of right now that they will be checked during peer code review where we check each others code.
- We are however not completely sure about the meaning of acceptance tests and will therefore have to ask or read more about acceptance tests to get a better understanding of this point.

### 5. The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)
- We should make sure we use as much of the existing code as possible, to avoid writing unnecessary code. There is a lot of functionality in the existing code base. We will try to work in a modular way, if we want additional functionality from already existing methods we should do it in our methods. This is to prevent other dependencies to crash.
- Since we haven’t gotten started on our app, we can’t say anything about our design choices.

### 6. The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
- As of yet we have not created or implemented anything with regards to our application which makes this question hard to answer.

### 7. The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
- We noticed that we had a hard time understanding the existing code base and its structural design. To prevent this for future developers we will try to provide some basic structural documentation of the overall design and also class/modules diagrams to make it easier to see dependencies.

### 8. Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
- We have currently decided on a pattern for user stories. One whole story will be labeled with a number x and a colour. The following subtasks will then be labeled with the same colour and subnumbers (i.e x.1, x.2 and so forth). The user stories and subtasks will also be marked with expected velocities.
- We have also created a structure for effort estimation in terms of a burn up-chart which measures velocity. Our current target velocity is 80 points on average each week which corresponds to 10 points per person on average each week.
- In order to establish good user stories we need to have all of this in place.
- We have broken down our current user stories to smaller tasks, to get a better understanding of what specific tasks should be done and in which priority. We will also motivate why and for who the user stories are important, to insure that all user stories bring value to someone.  
- During the upcoming week we need to create a more detailed structure for acceptance criterias and task breakdown. This will be more simple to do once we have talked to the product owner and have more information about the specific requests. 

### 9. The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress
-   Since we haven’t started programming, there is no data for the KPIs.

### 10. Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself
- No code has been written yet so it is not possible to reflect upon this.

### 11. The roles you have used within the team
- Since we haven’t started on the implementation, we are unable to evaluate the roles. 
- The roles haven’t changed since last week, but we’ve decided that our Scrum Master also will be our contact person during communication with the product owner. 

### 12. The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
- We have a solid base for continuous reflection in terms of these questions. This will make it possible to be agile and constantly handle changes in our group dynamic, change requests from the product owner and other changes. 
- The aim is to always reflect upon our work and tackle the issues and changes that we have identified. 
- We have come to the understanding that the previous fixed meeting days (Monday and Friday) are not ideal, since we will have a meeting with the product owner every wednesday. Therefore we will, from now on, have our fixed meeting days on monday, wednesday and thursday - to make sure we can combine the review with the meeting with the product owner, and write our group reflections afterwards.
- In order to reach our aim we need to continue to reflect on a weekly basis, keep in touch with our product owner and make sure that everytime we identify a problem we need to address a solution to that problem. 

### 13. The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
- Week 1: 12h (lectures + meeting + individual reflection).
- Week 2: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.5h ,(lectures + meeting + individual reflection).
- Week 3: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11h (meeting + lecture + supervision + meeting + individual reflection + lecture)
- The above does not include individual time spent on e.g. reading course material.
- In the coming weeks every group member will fill in how much time they have spent. We will then calculate an average based on that data.


### 14. The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
- From the feedback we got from the supervisor regarding our work processes, we came to the understanding that we need to change start- and end time of our sprints. Motivation to this change has been stated in question 12.
- During this week we also got to talk to a boat captain who gave us basic information about the work flow in a port. We still haven’t had the first meeting with the product owner.

### 15. Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
- We decided not to use individual forks of the project repo
- We decided to put our meeting notes on github. We will also start using github’s Issues functionality when appropriate, and we might try the wiki functionality.

### 16. Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say
- Our current usage of Scrum is primarily based on the Scrum lectures and exercises. 
- The changes we made in our user stories are based on the lecture from this monday, where we got feedback.
