# Week 1

### 1. The chosen scope of the application under development including priority of features and for whom you are creating value
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction

### 2. Your social contract, which means you should create one in the first week 
- The social contract should be a guideline for the groups' work. At the moment the social contract has been established and works for us. It's important to constantly reflect upon the social contract in order to coordinate the work within in the team in a better way

### 3. The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve with your application
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction 

### 4. Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed and with whom
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction

### 5. The design of your application (choice of APIs, architecture patterns etc)
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction

### 6. The behavioural overview of your application (for instance through use cases, interaction diagrams or similar)
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction

### 7. The structural overview of your application (such as class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams)
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction

### 8. Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation
- Not possible to reflect upon yet, will be possible when we’ve received the project instruction



### 9. The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress
#### Burn up chart (accepted velocity vs points taken)
- One problem we might have is estimating the velocity correctly which might lead to us taking more or less points than we can handle. We will solve this by logging the amount of points we complete each sprint and compare it to the current estimated velocity so that we know if we have to change our velocity. With this KPI we will also be able to tell if our ability to estimate velocity changes. Our goal is to make the gap between estimated velocity and completed points per sprint smaller.

#### Code Coverage in %
- Another issue might be to know how much of our code is correct. To solve this we will log the percentage of code that is covered by unit tests. We want to have as high code coverage as possible and at least cover 70% of the code, with an exception for uncheckable code such as UI.

#### Code deletion
- The final thing that we are looking at is deletion of code which generally implies that the planning phase was not extensive enough. We will therefore measure the amount of code deleted by lines commited to git, so that we know if we write unnecessary code. If we see that a lot of code is getting deleted we will know that we have to plan more before we code. This way we will not spend too much time at writing code that will not get used.

### 10. Code quality using a tool such as Findbugs (1 point if your code includes issues concerning correctness or bad style, 2 points if you have dodgy or performance issues and 3 points if the code is fine), only asses the code you have written yourself
- No code has been written yet

### 11. The roles you have used within the team
- No code has been written yet. It’s important to create a good role distribution in order to balance the work time among the group. At the moment, the scrum master role will rotate among three individuals of the group. Each group member will review another group group member’s code

### 12. The agile practices you have used for the current sprint
- We have had a reflection on the first part of the project.

### 13. The time you have spent on the course (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
- 14h (lectures + meeting + individual reflection).

### 14. The sprint review (either in terms of outcome of the current week's exercise or meeting the product owner)
- We have not had a review yet.

### 15. Best practices for using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.)
- We will be using git for version control and github as a repository.

### 16. Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say
- We’ve reflected upon the scrum-exercises in a separate document. We have nothing further to say on this point yet.
